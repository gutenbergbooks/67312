<div><h1>PREFACE</h1></div>

<p>The purpose of this story is to form some
impression of salient facts and tendencies in
Canadian life, and to show its strength, and
through its strength, its weakness. So I
planned before the gods ruled for war, and
the soldiers began to write history with the
sword which, despite Lytton, is proved infinitely
mightier than the pen.</p>

<p>However, here is the book, and I hope the
reader will not be sorry to meet again old
friends. Elsie has—though she does not intend
it—a serious purpose.</p>

<p>The English have never truly understood
the Colonial.</p>

<p>In May of last year (1914) a writer in the
<span class='it'>Times</span> said that he had lived in Canada for
a number of years, and was satisfied that
Canada was becoming Americanized, because
the Canadian talked with an American accent.
It was possible that what he saw and regarded
with alarm is what I have here drawn in
gentle satire. Society is our bane; and a new
society is certain to be, in many respects,
intolerable. The craze for, and hunt after,
society is not limited to any country; it
is a world-wide weakness. The Snob is—as
Thackeray showed us—ubiquitous.</p>

<p>As to my references to the Spread-Eagle
citizens of the United States, I have had access
to two books, <span class='it'>The Loyalists of Massachusetts</span>,
by John H. Stark, Boston, published by himself,
and <span class='it'>The True History of the American
Revolution</span>, by Sydney George Fisher, (Lippincott).
These are remarkable books; and a
knowledge of the contents of either would
go far to enable an Englishman to measure
the Canadian’s attitude towards the United
States. The story these books tell parallels
that set forth in the press, as shown by the
onslaught of German hordes into Belgium.
The outstanding difference is that whereas the
Germans cry “Kultur” the Yankees yelled
“Liberty.” The Archives of the United States
tell of 30,000 cases of outrage against the
Loyalists which, I fancy, is a greater number
than can be laid at the door of the Huns.</p>

<p>The books mentioned are significant of a
popular move. That this move should have
originated in the “Land of the Free” is remarkable.
That popular appreciation should
have been held from the Canadian so long is
deplorable. That recognition has been withheld
from Canadians is shown by the after-dinner
speech made a few years ago at New
York, by a noble Lord. The gentleman I refer
to is reported to have said in effect: “The
Revolutionists would have been unworthy of
their ancestors had they not taken up arms.”
The implied inference is that the Loyalists
were unworthy of their ancestors.</p>

<p>I do not claim the right to speak for any
one but myself, but as all my ancestors were
in America before the Revolution, few have a
better claim. Canada is peopled by a sound
stock, somewhat lacking in philosophy. It is
an important asset to civilization and, as has
been proved in Flanders, an heroic constituent
of the British Empire. But our people need
a truer appreciation of proper values; when
they have this, they will be second to none
among the peoples of the world. But at present
we do not lack that virtue which finds
reward within itself.</p>

<p>The reader is asked to believe that this
book was designed and largely written before
August, 1914.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 15th.</span></span></p>

<p>Mumsie is a dear, and I am going to put all
about her in this diary. Mumsie says I am an
old-fashioned girl (how little she knows me!),
but I’ll be old-fashioned enough anyhow to
keep a diary. It will be useful to read about
the people, and parties, and things I’m going
to enjoy. Yes, enjoy is the word. Dances and
afternoon teas, and those things the rich
people do, I’m going to have my share of. I’m
glad I’m a girl, especially when one has such
a good aunt as Mumsie. She was nothing
more than a friend of my mother—the mother
I never knew. And, I am sure, the best of
friends!</p>

<p>Just to think I am really to spend a winter
in this great Canadian City! I shall call it
the City of Mammon. After my village home
that seems the only name for it, and there is
evidence of wealth everywhere. I almost gasp
when I think of what some things I see must
have cost, the silk dresses, the great hats with
ostrich plumes, the motors. And I must confess
to being dazed when I came out of the
station. The bells clanged so loudly and the
engines puffed as if they wished to specially
frighten me; but they didn’t, that is, not much.
Perhaps it is that the station held the noises in
under its great, glass roof; but the noise and
the buffeting, and the many people in a hurry
made a strange confusion. At home the
station roof is the vault of Heaven, so that we
score sometimes in our village. And when we
got into the street the cars, the motors, and
the lights flashing here and there—it was all
so fairy-like and heavenly that—Oh! it is good
to be alive.</p>

<p>Mumsie has given me such a big room with
an outlook over the street. I feel almost as
Cinderella must have felt when at the Prince’s
Ball before the midnight bell. I wonder if I
shall be asked to any balls! But of course I
shall. If Uncle should try to be an old fogey—but
he won’t.</p>

<p>That is enough to write about for the first
day. No, I must put down more about Mumsie.
When she met me at the station and took
me in her arms and kissed me, it seemed as if
her heart opened and I fell right in; and when
she spoke I felt as if I had known her voice all
my life. She had a hundred things to ask
about myself: how she thought of them all I
can’t imagine. She is full of fun, with lots
of amusing stories, or at least she seems to
make fun out of almost anything. She has
reddish hair—a poet would no doubt call it
golden—which she does like the Queen, and
her voice when she gets talking is generally
loud, though the louder it gets the nicer it
sounds, it is so cheery. My uncle, her husband,
Mr. George Somers, is a largish man
with roast-beef cheeks and gray hair, though
he is not the least bit old looking. He has a
straight nose, a full and polished forehead,
and a cropped, white moustache. He is a
lawyer, and has a voice for humbugging with.
I like him, and there is a twinkle in his eye.</p>

<p>P.S. I am so happy!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 16th.</span></span></p>

<p>I looked out of my window this morning and
the trees glistened prettily in the sunlight. I
could not help thinking of the Fairy Godmother.
But I mustn’t think these thoughts.
I am a grown-up person of eighteen. Though
it doesn’t matter what I write here, as I am
never going to show this diary to anybody, not
even to the beloved Mumsie.</p>

<p>After breakfast we, that is, Mumsie and I,
set out on a shopping expedition. I knew
them all by name: Horace’s, Lewis’s, and Carlisle’s;
I had at home pored over their advertisements
so often. And just to think I was
really going to visit them and buy lots of
things! Dad had given me one hundred dollars,
saying I must dress myself properly.
One hundred dollars! I have never before had
so much money to spend. Poor Dad! he must
find it so dull living in the country, and his
patients are such poor pay.</p>

<p>We went to Lewis’s first and bought an
evening dress and the duckiest little hat that
ever was, and after that we went to Horace’s.
This I knew was really the fashionable shop.
Mumsie said we were to buy a suit; she said
I would need one. Indeed, I already felt I
was shabby, and was sorry I had not put on
my new hat at Lewis’s and had my old one
sent home.</p>

<p>I gasped as we entered Horace’s, the
dresses were all so grand, and there were so
many ladies present. No person paid any
attention to us at first; but when they did they
looked at Mumsie first and then at me, and
their eyes (I think) lingered on me.</p>

<p>After we had made our purchases, Mumsie
took me to a ribbon counter, not far away from
a most beautifully dressed woman. Her
ermine stole did not hide a diamond and sapphire
brooch at her throat. Her blue velvet
suit was in the latest fashion. She was large
and dark. Her face was rounded, and lofty
eyebrows made her eyes appear prominent. A
cold, deliberate manner gave the impression
of absolute control. She bowed to Mumsie
and my heart went into my mouth. I am silly
to be so fluttered and shy. The strange lady
advanced and held her hand out to Mumsie.</p>

<p>“How do you do Mrs. Somers? How is Mr.
Somers? I hope you are all well.”</p>

<p>“Quite well, thank you,” replied Mumsie,
not too genially I thought.</p>

<p>“You will take a hand in our Ragamuffins’
Feast, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, I would not miss for the
world,” answered Auntie.</p>

<p>Mumsie’s manner was more formal than I
had yet known her use, and it struck me the
lady had something on her mind.</p>

<p>“I suppose you are doing your Christmas
shopping early out of consideration for the
help.”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly,” replied Mumsie, “I am
helping my friend here. Elsie, let me introduce
you to Mrs. Lien. This is my niece, Elsie
Travers, who is to spend the winter with me.
She is a debutante.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Lien flashed me a critical glance, and
said rather grandly: “I have no doubt Miss
Travers will enjoy herself. It must be very
interesting getting her outfit.”</p>

<p>When she had gone I wondered whether her
manner had wounded or gladdened me. I had
received something of a shock.</p>

<p>At dinner I said to Uncle: “Who is Mrs.
Lien?”</p>

<p>Uncle repeated the question with a smile
growing on his lips and the merriest twinkle
in his eyes.</p>

<p>“My dear, one would think you were Mrs.
Grundy herself,” laughed Mumsie, “by the
severe way in which you asked the question.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lien is a Yankee; so we know nothing
of her antecedents. She is the wife of Stephen
Lien, who on his part,” said Uncle slowly “is
the son of his father.”</p>

<p>I suppose I showed I was puzzled.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lien, senior,” continued Uncle, “was
an English attorney who came to this country
in the forties and accommodated the farmers
by lending them money.”</p>

<p>“How very considerate of him,” I claimed,
while Auntie looked oddly at Uncle.</p>

<p>“Yes, he used consideration and discrimination
also, for he was a master hand at selecting
those farmers whose lands were good, and who
were themselves less capable.”</p>

<p>There was now a curious smile, cynical I
think it should be called, on Uncle’s lips. I
did not know what to say, so I said nothing,
which I have decided is sometimes the wisest
thing to say.</p>

<p>“He soon owned the farm,” continued
Uncle.</p>

<p>“That is a very clever way of making
money—” I began.</p>

<p>“Elsie!” cried Mumsie in horror.</p>

<p>What had I said to startle her?</p>

<p>“There was a period of bad crops,” said
Uncle, reflectively. “A humane man who
would lend money to farmers, a man with a
heart and a conscience would be a godsend in
a new country, but unfortunately Lien pere
was not a humane man, and his son, and his
son’s wife, and their bright boy, Charlie——”</p>

<p>“Hush!” said Auntie.</p>

<p>I wonder why!</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said Uncle gravely, “we owe a debt
of gratitude to our forefathers. This land is
to-day drunk with prosperity, yet every foot
of our broad acres, these miles and miles of
fertile fields, have been won by the sweat of
toiling manhood, supported by the tears of
trusting, oftentimes gentle, womanhood. I
am afraid the fruit of all these sacrifices are
not falling into the hands of those who are
worthiest of them.”</p>

<p>“That might be said of any land,” objected
Mumsie. “I suppose all land was wild once
upon a time.”</p>

<p>“In Europe the land was cleared two or
three thousand years ago; our land has been
cleared within the last few generations,” retorted
Uncle. “I don’t suppose our ancestors
in the British Isles or in Normandy found it
much hardship to live in log huts, to do their
own washing, or to forego their morning
paper.”</p>

<p>“That is where the Lien money came from—from
grinding these poor farmers’?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I was not sorry for the reply, because it
showed I was not wrong in my instinctive dislike
of the good lady.</p>

<p>“And what does the present Mr. Lien do?”</p>

<p>“He’s a stockbroker. When a rich man
dies and leaves a son of no particular abilities
they make a broker of him. The stock market
covers a multitude of sins.” Uncle was
smiling again.</p>

<p>“Does it?” I asked innocently.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, a multitude of sins. Now one may
not keep a tavern and sell booze——”</p>

<p>“George!” exclaimed Mumsie with mock
horror.</p>

<p>“I wanted to be frank, my dear.”</p>

<p>“You always do,” she complained cheerily.</p>

<p>“One may not keep a tavern or even be a
brewer and keep respectability, but it is quite
in order to hold stock in a brewery company
or hotel.”</p>

<p>“What a cynic you are,” I cried.</p>

<p>“And what we have come to now! Old man
Lien was kept in his place in the old days. He
was a plain man with a hard fist. They are
gentry. The son and his son’s wife lord it
to-day. But the foundation of their fortune
and proud estate was the life-blood of men
and women whose veins ran with better blood,
who had truer gentility than they can ever
claim with all their social rudeness.”</p>

<p>“But Uncle,” I pleaded, “because the old
man was a skin-flint, you would not visit his
sins on the son and the son’s wife, would
you?”</p>

<p>“ ‘The sins of the father,’ my young lady.
I am no more charitable than my Maker.
Without his money old Lien would never have
had any notice taken of him; and, if you pay
obeisance at his shrine, and drink his claret
cup, you may, if your imagination be strong
enough, taste the salt of tears shed long ago.”</p>

<p>“George! What a Tory!”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” replied Uncle, and shaking
his finger at me: “Remember, Elsie, if Belle
takes you to call on Mrs. Lien, you call on her
money, on her father’s guilty money, remember
that!”</p>

<p>“George, you dear old ass. Why do you put
such ideas into the child’s head’?” (Child
indeed!) Then turning to me: “Don’t pay
any attention to what he says, Elsie. Old man
Lien—as your Uncle calls him—may have
made his start that way, but the great fortune
they now have has grown from wise investment.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, if I sow a kernel of wheat and it
produces twenty, it is the same wheat,” retorted
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>That was the end of it for a time, as we rose
from the table. Mumsie put her arm about
me and said: “Pay no attention to George, to
what he says, when in a teasing mood. He’s
incorrigible!” and she made a grimace at him
which seemed to please him, for he seized her
hand and squeezed it.</p>

<p>“I like him,” I said, when she and I were
alone, and I think my tribute pleased her.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 17th.</span></span></p>

<p>Last night after I went to bed I thought and
thought. At last I am really “in the world.”
I had read so often of Mrs. Lien in the society
news in the city papers, that to be actually
living in the house with one who would dare
to attack her is cheering. And Mumsie is so
glorious and dignified. Hers is a native dignity.
I still feel as if her kindness were all
about me like a glorious cloak. I wish I could
put my present, overflowing happiness into
cold storage, so that I could enjoy it bit by bit
in after years.</p>

<p>Immediately after breakfast this morning
Mumsie told me she was giving the day to the
work of preparing for the Ragamuffins’ Feast.
Mumsie is a woman of capacity and makes no
false moves.</p>

<p>The first thing she did was to go to the telephone.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mount, this is Belle Somers speaking.
I wish you to give me some lettuce from your
conservatories for the poor boys’ feast.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“Six heads.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m sorry. I’ll tell Mrs. Lien,” and
she banged on the receiver, and sat on the seat
beside me, her face twitching with annoyance.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked impulsively.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>The telephone rang again.</p>

<p>“Yes.” Mumsie answered.</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“Yes, Mrs. Lien is managing it this year.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“All right, you’ll send them to the hall to
my care.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>And again the receiver was put back on the
hook and Mumsie, trembling with agitation,
sat again beside me.</p>

<p>“I know how to fix that woman,” she declared.
“I told her I would report to Mrs.
Lien, and then, my dear, she promised not only
to send the six heads of lettuce I asked for, but
a turkey and a dozen Charlotte russes as
well.” In delivering the last sentence Mumsie’s
chin protruded in a manner I judged to
be an unconscious imitation of Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>We went to the hall where a great many
ladies were working among hampers of food.
They all seemed nice and genially kind as
Mumsie introduced me. We all got to work,
laid tables, and arranged the food. One of the
women who seemed to take a special interest
in me was Mrs. Bassett. She has a large nose
with prominent eyebrows, her chin is pointed,
and her mouth drawn into a perpetual smile.
I suppose she is daily described as aristocratic
looking. But I know what she will look like
at eighty with her teeth gone—a witch. In the
old days she’d have hardly escaped burning.
She told me she had two daughters; one my
age, Ethel, and hoped we would be friends.</p>

<p>I found the good ladies very uninteresting,
though Mrs. Bassett, with her sharp eyes, is
capable of humour at times. Nothing was said
about society—which is growing my chief
interest—and they dressed dowdily.</p>

<p>Mrs. Lien in all her grandeur, came in while
we worked, asked a few questions and departed.
She did not even nod to me, though
she must have seen me. I am inclined to
believe that to be kind means to be commonplace.
Mrs. Lien seems to be <span class='it'>neither</span>.</p>

<p>I was waiting with impatience to talk to
Uncle on the subject of Mrs. Mount, but succeeded
in restraining myself until Uncle had
finished his first helping of meat. My idea was
that, his hunger appeased, I could get him off
to a better start. I asked innocently enough:
“Uncle, do you know Mrs. Mount?”</p>

<p>His eyes met mine and then settled on his
wife.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mount! Do I know Mrs. Mount?
Belle, why do you not introduce Elsie to someone
milder than that old battle-axe?”</p>

<p>“I have not introduced her,” replied Mumsie
promptly. “I asked Mrs. Mount over the
’phone for some lettuce for our feast and had
to bring in Mrs. Lien before I could get it.”</p>

<p>Uncle roared with laughter.</p>

<p>“Elsie, during your stay with us, you will
get an insight into human nature if into nothing
else,” was his severe comment. “Mrs.
Mount” he went on, “is a social-climber; the
term is self-explanatory and she and her
notions are illuminating. Her past history
would make a compendium on the process of
social climbing, and the progress of snobbery
invaluable to those who have the mean ambition
to inflict themselves upon their betters,
or, perhaps it were more correct to say, intrude
where they are not wanted.”</p>

<p>I was surprised and piqued by his harshness.
I think that “pique” looks well.</p>

<p>“Is it wrong,” I asked “to try and get into
society?”</p>

<p>“Not wrong, Elsie, but probably unworthy.
Of course much depends upon the society
aimed at. Ambition is, as the poets have often
taught us, a fruitful source of woe, humiliation,
and remorse, and social ambition is to my
mind the pettiest of vanities. It is as pernicious
to-day as when Greece produced—and
slew—Socrates.”</p>

<p>I then asked a question which in these new
days has often occurred to me.</p>

<p>“What is society? What would a philosopher
call it? Let me see! Society is an
affiliation of friends mutually acceptable. If
it remained so, that would be good enough;
unfortunately it has tended to the wealthy
gathering into a clique, whose doings are
naturally the more spectacular and so attract
the weakling, the snob, the social-climber.”</p>

<p>Mustering up what I hope looked like
world-wisdom, I said: “That Uncle, is also,
a natural process.”</p>

<p>He laughed at me, quite kindly.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly, you wise miss, Mammon has
always had his measure of worshippers. But
the point is that to enter such society was
never a worthy ambition. In the days of
Charles II, society, as we use the word, meant
the court circle, and that was certainly a discreditable
institution. Queen Victoria, of
course, made her circle one of a high standard;
but, society in her day no longer meant
the circle nearest the throne, nor does it convey
that meaning to-day.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” continued Uncle in his kind
tones. (He certainly is taking trouble with
me—dear man!) “I need not talk about
society in England. One may not know all
about everything in England and the English
after a three month’s visit. But of Canada I
do know much: and this—that both this country
and the United States are society mad. If
there is any greater snob on earth than the
average Canadian, it is the average citizen of
that particular Land of the Free.”</p>

<p>I do not like the Yankees, or mind hearing
them abused; but I object to hearing the supposed
failings of my own people set forth.</p>

<p>“Uncle, you are severe.”</p>

<p>“Elsie,” Uncle replied in tones that were
low, and I thought bore an echo of sadness,
“you are on the threshold of life; your happiness
is largely your own to make or break.
If you develop the society bug,—the society
craze—you kiss good-bye to your peace of
mind, and peace is the true foundation of happiness.
When you choose your friends,
imagine yourself with them alone on a desert
island. Under those circumstances what sort
of companions would they be? That’s the
test.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” cried Mumsie. “Isn’t the girl
down here to see some life, to go to balls and
parties, and have as good a time generally as
we can give her?”</p>

<p>“I was just telling her—” he began, but was
promptly cut short.</p>

<p>“You were just trying to fill her head with
nonsense. A desert island. Fiddlesticks!”</p>

<p>There was naturally a pause after this, but
I was glad to see Uncle was not completely
down. I watched his face, rejoicing at the
evident signs of consideration before a new
assault.</p>

<p>“I once knew a politician who came from
Alberta. He made a lot of money, his enemies
said by shady means, but I believe by his
native cleverness in land speculation. His was
a happy home, the family united by affection.
And then all went society mad. Paterfamilias
took to horses and the boys followed suit. To
make a long story short, with the advent of
riches and horses, happiness flew out of the
window, and there was ruin.”</p>

<p>Uncle was now cracking nuts; in a minute
he would be rising and going to his den, and
I had not yet heard about Mrs. Mount. So,
I asked again.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Mount, my child, was the daughter
of old Bustard, who—how wonderful when we
go back to the beginnings—kept a tavern at a
crossroads in the country. First he sold butter
and sugar openly, and grog on the sly;
then he blossomed into keeping a tavern. He
made money fast and speculated. He dabbled
in the Chicago wheat pit, and in real estate.
He appreciated the lessons of history and got
out at the top of several booms. In short, he
was a successful money-maker, and collected
a pile, and then died. Mount, who was, what
out west they call a shyster, married the girl,
Miss Bustard. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“And how did she with those disadvantages
manage to climb into society?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Money first; then the Church. She gave
to charities, tinted her hair a golden yellow,
drove a fine pair of horses before the motor
came chu-ing along, carried impecunious dowagers
home from meetings of the Women’s
Auxiliary. Oh, it was all easy, only a matter
of persistence. The dowagers had to ask her
to tea, and when she was able to pay them back,
she took care that the papers made a splash
of it. So Mrs. Mount got thick with the old
families.”</p>

<p>“But,” I objected (I can’t help asking questions),
“if she was so generous to charities,
why did she wish to limit Mumsie to two heads
of lettuce?”</p>

<p>Uncle was, I think, needlessly scornful as
he replied: “You don’t feed a fish bait after
you have caught him.”</p>

<p>That was all.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 18th.</span></span></p>

<p>Only a week from Christmas! Mrs. Bassett’s
tea was delightful; that is to me. Her
house was not very big, being semi-detached
and the crowding was certainly dreadful.</p>

<p>I’m sure those present were all such ladies
as Uncle would have approved of, but somehow
to me, they seemed much alike, some even
shabby, and their kindness and graciousness I
took (Dear me! am I becoming a weak snob?
It looks like it) as an effort to make up for
their deficiencies in plumage.</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast Mrs. Bassett rang
up Mumsie and asked if I would care to go.</p>

<p>“A waste of good money,” was Uncle’s comment.</p>

<p>“But the woman must do something to
return the hospitality shown Ethel, and it is
out of the question for her to afford a dance,”
stormed Mumsie.</p>

<p>“But if she did not allow Ethel to know all
and sundry, she need not feel it incumbent on
her to make this sort of return,” retorted
Uncle, nailing his colours to the mast. “Moreover,
when I was a boy the full expenses of a
dance was some ten dollars and we enjoyed it.
To-day the pace is tuned so high that a dance
at home costs ten times as much; and, for a
flare up at a hotel or public-hall, a thousand
dollars is too little. To so-called leaders of
fashion, like Mrs. Lien, or social climbers like
the Mount woman, the advertisement is no
doubt worth the money. But few people in
Canada who are truly distinguished can feel
it a satisfactory way of spending money.”</p>

<p>“A woman—” began Mumsie.</p>

<p>“There is an old tradition that if a woman
wishes to give her daughter a run in the matrimonial
market, it is necessary to bring her
out. But when I look back on the society
belles I have known, the percentage of them
who are now old maids, or have become victims
of unfortunate alliances is enormous.”</p>

<p>“The crooked stick at last,” I suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, or the bad egg.”</p>

<p>“Ho,” grunted Mumsie.</p>

<p>“A girl or a young man,” continued Uncle,
with a grin, “makes a stab at society for two
reasons. One is to have a good time with
plenty of excitement; the other is chase and
capture a partner in life. But with the average
mother it’s the chance at a husband first.
And this I’m sure of, that so far as the big
game of dances, parties, and so on goes, it is
sheer wasted money and often the ruin of a
girl’s health.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” from Mumsie, whereat I laughed.</p>

<p>“Then, too,” went on Uncle, after a mocking
bow to his interrupting wife, “when the
girl has got her husband, he is nearly always
a waster. I am satisfied that the proportion
of unfortunate matings made in your dizzy
whirl is fifty per cent higher than in more
sober circles. There now!”</p>

<p>“You seem to have strong ideas on the subject
of matrimony,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“He’s got strong ideas on most subjects,”
protested Mumsie, “and he’s poured them
into my ears for twenty years. I’m fed up
with his nonsense. Now that you’re here, he’s
got a new victim. And, when Jack comes it
will be worse and worse!” Mumsie pretended
to be in despair. Who was “Jack”? At the
mention of Jack I saw Uncle fumble in his
pocket and produce a letter.</p>

<p>“Talk of the devil,” he said. “Jack will be
here for Christmas.”</p>

<p>“Good! and now you’re in for it, Elsie,”
cried Mumsie. “When these men have talked
to you for a week, you may consider yourself
master of the accumulated knowledge of the
ages.”</p>

<p>Uncle made no effort to counter this sally,
and Mumsie continued as if she had read the
question I had in mind, the most natural question.</p>

<p>“Jack, my dear, Jack Bang, (What a
name!) is a railway contractor, miner, prospector,
or what not; as strong as an ox, as
cheery as a sand-boy, as generous as a sailor
on leave, and with a jaw like that of Napoleon.”</p>

<p>“Is he——”</p>

<p>“Yes, very good looking. Jack was the misfit
of the family.”</p>

<p>“He is the only one of the six who has any
brains,” protested Uncle stormily.</p>

<p>“He came to visit us once when he was fifteen,
and he and my Micawber, (Mumsie
sometimes speaks of Uncle as her Micawber)
became great friends. The result———”</p>

<p>“Leave Jack alone; let the girl form her
own opinion of him,” put in Uncle, and Mumsie
complied with his request by being silent.</p>

<p>I wonder if I shall like Mr. Bang. Jack
Bang! Such an odd name. Mrs. Bang! I
don’t think I like westerners; not that I have
ever seen any.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 19th, Sunday.</span></span></p>

<p>Of course we went to church. The afternoon
I put in writing this diary. I often wonder
what makes me write it, but write it I will.
I believe Mumsie knows already I’m keeping
it. If I am forced to confess, I will say I am
doing it for practice, that some day I shall
publish a novel.</p>

<p>I know Uncle would think more of me if I
had such an ambition. Perhaps it would be
a good thing to tell him. No, he would cease
then to be such “good copy,” as the journalists
call it. I do so enjoy getting him and
Mumsie at verbal fighting; it’s great fun.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span class='sc'>December 20th.</span></p>

<p>To-day we had the feast—and it <span class='it'>was</span> a feast.
Dirty little ragamuffins!</p>

<p>Of course Mumsie was in attendance early.
It was all one wild scramble, food, dirty imps,
steam and struggle. I found it hard work and
appreciated the reason why the feast was held
so early, five days before Christmas. It was
that we might get rest in time for our own festivities.
I was disappointed that no stylish
people came to help. Indeed, Mrs. Lien did
turn up, also several other smart ladies, but
they merely grinned, tossed their heads, and
went away. Virtue is very dull—there is no
question of that.</p>

<p>I have made up my mind about one thing.
I’m going to get into society. It’s the spirit
of the age. So why not? I’ll be in the fashion
so soon, and far, as I can. I’m sure that
Uncle’s ideas are old-fashioned. Of course I
love Uncle and all that, but I know he’s
wrong. I’ve used my eyes. I’m sure of it.
Times change, fashions change, customs
change, don’t they? And, people change,
nations change, everything changes. The
young are as likely to be right as the old, for
<span class='it'>they</span> can’t be rid of their old opinions. How
nice it must be to go every place and to everything,
and to have one’s name always figuring
prominently in the notices—like Georgie
Cochrane, and Mabel Lien, and Doris Mount.</p>

<p>I know now why I am writing this diary!
It’s partly practice, that some day I may
write something good and make a name for
myself. It is also to record my passing impressions
of the society doings I <span class='it'>am</span> going to
enjoy. For after I get back home again to
the country, I’ll have plenty of time and it will
be dull if I don’t employ myself. To-day in
town I heard one girl say to a friend: “Good-bye—good
luck. Be good and you’ll be happy—but
you’ll have a mighty slow time.” Now
I wonder!</p>

<p>And I have a right to a place in society. My
grandfather was an army officer. So even
Uncle could not call me a “social climber.” I
only wish to see real life and get some enjoyment.
The thing to do is to make friends
among those who have aspirations and aims
similar to mine—true friends, good friends. I
wonder if Grandfather had any more joy in
being honourable and upright than “old man”
Lien, who lent to and ruined unfortunate
farmers, and other incapable persons. Of
course, old Lien had no friends outside his
own class, but then Grandfather’s friends borrowed
money from him and never returned it,—and
drank his port wine. So I wonder
which got the greater joy from life.</p>

<p>No doubt Grandfather would have despised
old Lien, while Lien would have pitied Grandfather.
There is no doubt that Mabel Lien has
had a better time than I. And I can quite
conceive that old Lien’s joy in his wide, rich
lands was greater than Grandfather’s could
be in being comparatively poor, however
respectable. Yes, Uncle doesn’t know everything,
and I’m not such a little girl as he
thinks.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 21st.</span></span></p>

<p>Nothing doing.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 22nd.</span></span></p>

<p>I have seen Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>Mumsie and I were going down Maple
Avenue when I saw her. She wore a large,
beautiful, black velvet hat, with ermine trimming,
and came marching down the street
majestically in her seal-skin jacket and ermine
stole. Her hair is gold: I don’t mean coppery
gold or any other kind of gold, but real, brassy,
gold-yellow. I had an eye on her some time
before Mumsie caught sight of her. I knew
it was Mrs. Mount—instinct told.</p>

<p>I grasped Mumsie by the arm and whispered.
“Yes, it is she,” she said.</p>

<p>From the way Mrs. Mount held her head it
was evidently her intention of passing us with
a mere bow. But to show how kind Mumsie
is, she exclaimed: “Oh, Mrs. Mount, thank
you so much for the lettuce, and things.”</p>

<p>It was very well done, just as if speaking to
her had been an afterthought. We all stopped;
Mumsie and she shook hands, and I’m
sure I beamed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount gazed across the street for a
moment ere she replied: “It was nothing,
really, it was nothing; I’m always only too
glad to help anything Mrs. Lien or you are
arranging. What would the poor do without
Mrs. Lien? I have my own troubles it is
true,” she continued without pause in her
drawling voice, “chasing around these horrid
shops for corsets, corsets! Do you know,
really, it is too awful for words. Those I can
get here are quite impossible, and the others
have not arrived from Paris.” Mrs. Mount
accompanied her words by protruding her
chin after the manner I had observed Mumsie
affect.</p>

<p>“Too bad,” murmured Mumsie sympathetically.</p>

<p>“Do you know, really it is.” She spoke as
if every other word were in capitals. “I always
get mine from Paris,” and with a most
pronounced sigh, “but they cost a hundred
francs a pair, twenty dollars a pair!”</p>

<p>With the closing of this speech she turned
and regarded me, and Mumsie introduced me.</p>

<p>“Nice looking little girl, a bud?” Mrs.
Mount was pleased to say. “Well, my dear,
you will have a good time, if you make friends
with the right people; make it a rule, only the
right people.”</p>

<p>“That’s very———” I began. I wanted
to let her see I appreciated what she was saying;
but she went on in her loud, slow voice:</p>

<p>“Isn’t Christmas a bore? I have just
bought some things for some reduced gentle
people. One has to look after the unfortunate
of one’s own class you know really—old
mother and three old maids—so sad you
know.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure———”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose it is kind, but we all have to
do it. But I must go, Sir Thomas and Lady
Billings are coming to dinner to-night, and I
must call at the florists, and goodness knows
what else—Christmas prices too.”</p>

<p>“Your own———”</p>

<p>“My own conservatories don’t seem able to
produce the flowers these professionals can;
do you know, really, my gardener is supposed
to be an expert from England. Now, Miss
Travers,” she turned to me, “do take my tip
and know only nice people. They are the only
people who live, really they are. Good-bye
Mrs. Somers. Mr. Somers well? Glad to
hear it. We never see him now: I know he is
not fond of society, so strange!”</p>

<p>I said: “Good-bye Mrs. Mount. I’m delighted
to have met you,” in my best attempt
at the proper manner. I wanted to make a
good impression. Mumsie seemed amused, I
wonder why.</p>

<p>As we walked on I felt I had one foot on
the ladder; the position was improved. At
last I knew a leading lady in society.</p>

<p>“Well, Elsie, what do you think of her?”
Mumsie asked.</p>

<p>“I think she is most interesting,” I replied.</p>

<p>We trudged home.</p>

<p>As we came up the steps the door opened,
and a great man seemed to fall on Mumsie.
“Here I am again, Auntie, to bother you and
shock your friends over Christmas!”</p>

<p>Mumsie beamed more than ever.</p>

<p>“Elsie, this is Jack, Mr. Bang! Jack, this
is Miss Travers.”</p>

<p>“Hullo, Little Partner,” he cried. That
was his greeting. Familiar I call it. He
grasped my hand in his great paw. “I’ve
heard of you and your father: I judge you are
in town on a bit of a spree,” and Mr. Bang
grinned.</p>

<p>Perhaps my surprise at this remark showed
in my face, for he remarked: “There is more
than one kind of intoxication, you know,”
whereat Mumsie gave him a loving tap on the
shoulder, and said,</p>

<p>“Don’t begin lecturing her too soon, Jack,”
and turning to me, “Elsie, don’t take what he
may say to you too seriously. He is worse
than your uncle.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Auntie,” replied the reproved
one; “I’ll remember that.” And we entered
the house.</p>

<p>Of course, at dinner I told Uncle I had met
Mrs. Mount, and, of course, Uncle asked what
I thought of her.</p>

<p>“I could not quite make her out,” I replied,
which was quite true. With all her mighty
ways I did not altogether like her. She was
rather too high and mighty.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you something, Elsie,” said
Uncle in his fatherly way. “It is my guess
that her ladyship was not hunting corsets at
all, nor was she making purchases for impoverished
ladies; she was really talking for
effect.”</p>

<p>“Uncle, how ungenerous of you!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I know for a fact that Sir Thomas Billings
is in Toronto to-day, so she is <span class='it'>not</span> entertaining
him this evening.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I cried, flabbergasted.</p>

<p>“When you know more of the world, little
niece—” he said.</p>

<p>“When you know more of the world, Little
Partner,” this from Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“But Uncle how do people tolerate such a
fraud?” I put in.</p>

<p>“Tolerate! why people like it: it never
deceives: it only amuses. Mrs. Mount and her
sayings have amused us for twenty years.”</p>

<p>“Disgusting!” I felt annoyed.</p>

<p>“I suppose your experience has not been
large enough to teach you philosophy enough
for that,” put in Mr. Bang. Like his cheek
to be patronizing me!</p>

<p>“The public taste for cheap notorieties,
little people with a big noise, is on a par with
its taste for literature and the drama,” said
Mr. Bang, and the tone he used was bitter.
As I am some day going to write a book, I
thought I might as well find out more of this,
so I turned to him and asked: “Do you really
think so?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, the fact is plain as the nose on
your—er—on my face. The man who cultivates
a sound literary style and thinks the
public will buy his books because of it, is not
very far from the pawn shop.” (How vulgar!)
“So, too, the young man or maiden
who seeks to impress society with good manners
would do better to tie his or her head in
a wet blanket and cultivate a knowledge of
what’s what.”</p>

<p>“Elsie, Jack thinks all society people
fools,” laughed Mumsie.</p>

<p>“So they are!” stormed the young man.
“Look how much trash on paper finds a ready
market, while genius may be starving. Look
at the social columns of our newspapers and
see how nonentities find prominence.”</p>

<p>I was annoyed at this tirade, and the tone it
was uttered in, the bitterness. “Do you mean
to say,” I added, “that no clever people find
eminence in society; how about the great Disraeli,
is he not supposed to be the original of
‘Vivian Grey’?”</p>

<p>“That was England: this is Canada.
Society in England is more catholic than
here.”</p>

<p>I felt this was getting a little beyond me,
so I doubled back. “Don’t you think,” I
asked, “if some of your masters of literary
style could produce a ‘best seller’ they would
do so, and don’t you also think that some of
your bright examples of good manners would
be only too glad to occupy outstanding positions
in society?”</p>

<p>“Absurd! Absurd!” stormed Mr. Bang.
“A man of letters, a master of style, cannot
write trash. I’m told that Conrad once tried
to do it—and he couldn’t. Also it is impossible
for a man of brains and good manners
to attain eminence in the rushing society here.
There is too little real recompense for the
strain required. Vulgarity has no true attractiveness.”</p>

<p>“Don’t good manners count for anything?”
I asked meekly. Jack—I mean Mr. Bang—smiled
a smile of pitying tolerance.</p>

<p>“I once had an Englishman remark to me
that he found the ruder he was to people here
the more they esteemed him. He was a man
of education and intelligence. I give you his
opinion for what it is worth.”</p>

<p>“I can’t believe that,” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It is quite in keeping with the bluff of our
social-climbers,” said Uncle.</p>

<p>They both were against me. I looked to
Mumsie, but she shook her head, as if to say,
“Where are they leading the child?”</p>

<p>“I can tell you it is unsafe even to offer a
passing civility to a society lady one does not
know. I met a girl once carrying golf clubs;
we were members of the same club, I politely
offered to relieve her of the load. She declined.”</p>

<p>“Poor Jack,” murmured Mumsie.</p>

<p>“The poor girl thought that if she accepted
my civility I would make it the basis of
acquaintance, and we had not been introduced.
She did not know if I might belong to her set
or not. As for the value she placed upon herself
one may pity her.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Bang,—” I began, thinking that
something could be said, surely, from the girl’s
point of view.</p>

<p>“There is no but about it,” he interrupted,
rudely. “I can read these people like a book
———”</p>

<p>“It’s the schools that do it,” Uncle cut in.
“Our girls’ schools are too much under the
domination of such monstrosities, fed with
those delusions and snobberies. We need to
educate our educationalists.” I could see that
his feeling, too, was strong.</p>

<p>“The world is all wrong,” laughed Mumsie,
satirically.</p>

<p>“Anyhow, the girls’ schools are wrong,”
retorted Uncle. “Get at the inner workings
of those institutions, and you find one or two
brats of the <span class='it'>Nouveaux Riches</span>, at the head of
the strongest clique, making life hell for the
other girls, who won’t toady to them. The
result is the school becomes a breeding ground
for the society ‘bug’, as we have it in America.
The rich girls have the biggest hampers,
extravagant clothes, the most money to spend;
and are encouraged to show off to the full.
The girls’ school is the nursery-bed of worldliness.”</p>

<p>“And the boys’ schools?” asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Much the same: the natural cad once he
enters a fraternity house, dons a smoking
jacket, sticks a pipe in his mouth and thinks
he is a superior being. The whole system—for
boys and girls—is rotten and wrong.”</p>

<p>“I may say,” put in my fellow guest, “that
close on the time I asked Miss Fashion if I
might carry her golf-sticks I met a poor
woman carrying a valise. I took it from her.
She was grateful. The moral is that one may
help the old and homely, but not the young
and gay.”</p>

<p>“The old need help more than the strong,”
said Uncle.</p>

<p>“That reminds me of the story of the Irishman
in the street-car, who gave up his seat to
a wizened old maid,” said Mumsie. “ ‘Thank
you very much,’ said she. ‘Not at all, not at
all,’ replied Paddy. ‘Some people they gets
up only when a good-looking girl wants a seat,
but I don’t, sez I to meself sez I, Pat, it’s the
sex ye should honour, not the individual. Not
at all mum, not at all’.”</p>

<p>The joke was new to me and I laughed. The
men creatures brightened up too. So I gained
new courage and asked: “The boys and girls
of the old families,—what of them?”</p>

<p>“Ah, now, Elsie,” said Uncle, “you are
touching upon the really sad phase of the
question. The spectacle of the son or daughter
of self-respecting people fawning on the
vulgar-rich is unspeakably deplorable, and,
unfortunately, becoming more common day by
day.”</p>

<p>“Agreed, Uncle,” cried Mr. Bang, “and
even more apparent in conservative old England.”</p>

<p>“The kingdom of the mind,—that’s putting
it briefly—weakens before the spell of the
motor and the dizzy whirl,” continued Uncle.</p>

<p>“The only remedy is War,”<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> said Mr.
Bang, and seemed to glare at me.</p>

<p>“War!” I exclaimed, “how awful!” and I
glanced from the one to the other.</p>

<p>Mumsie shook her head despairingly and
rose from the table. As we left the dining-room
Uncle put his arm over my shoulder. “I
hope my ideas don’t frighten you,” he said.
“You are to enjoy life.” Dear Uncle!</p>

<p>Two experiences I have had to-day, making
the acquaintance of Mrs. Mount, and meeting
Mr. Bang. Were my relations with them
reversed, were I to meet Mr. Bang only occasionally
or not at all, and live in the same
house as Mrs. Mount, I feel I should be happier.
That shows what I think of Jack Bang’s
social fears.</p>

<p>I don’t know what to make of Mr. Bang,
except that I think I do not like him. Why
Uncle and he do not like society is because
society does not like them, and society does
not like them because—they take life too seriously.</p>

<p>But, I may as well record my impression of
this interfering visitor. Mr. Bang is fully six
feet tall and his shoulders broad. His hair
and small moustache are black; his face
square, clean-cut, and certainly powerful. In
repose his face is thoughtful, sometimes even
abstracted. I will put down what he says, for
what it may be worth, to use his own words.
I’m afraid he will be a kill-joy.</p>

<p>I will tell Mumsie confidentially, I am writing
a book; and if Uncle learns I am writing,
the fact I have already confided in her will
save me from embarrassment. Again Mr.
Bang called me Little Partner as he said good-night—I
suppose I am still a child in his eyes.
How dare he!</p>

<p>Shopping, Mumsie and I went down town.
The Christmas rush is on and happiness was
abroad. The snowflakes were falling softly.
I bought Mumsie a pair of gloves. For Uncle,
a box of cigars at $1.25, and for his nephew a
silk handkerchief, of all colours. We met the
Bassett girls with their mother in Lewis’s. It
appears to me that I am always meeting the
Bassetts. My mind is fully made up. I’m
for society with a big “S”. The Bassetts and
other good people bore me to death. I feel as
if I’ve burnt my boats. All the better!</p>

<p>Of course, I took Ethel’s hand with cordiality:
I realize that if I am to be a society success
I must be nice to everybody, whatever I feel.
But there was a price to pay: she returned
my cordiality by asking me to go skating with
her in the evening; and before I could invent
an excuse Mumsie told me to accept “and take
Jack.” Heavens!—and all I could do was to
smile and say “Thank you, I shall be delighted.”
Ethel and Mr. Bang! In parting
Ethel said she would call for us.</p>

<p>We met Mr. Bang by appointment.</p>

<p>Our cavalier had loaded himself with parcels.
He remarked, apologetically, that the
delivery men would have enough work to do
as it was: and even then when Mumsie made
more purchases he insisted on carrying them.
“I’ve done enough hard work to sympathize
with any worker,” he said. Worker indeed!
I could not help wondering what Mrs. Lien
or Mrs. Mount would say if they saw us. However,
Mumsie seemed indifferent. I suppose
Uncle’s ideas have had some effect.</p>

<p>After lunch Mumsie and I walked out to
deliver presents. I was introduced to many
of her friends; all genial, placid, and uninteresting.
Dinner passed with nothing said
worth recording, and after dinner Ethel Bassett
came and gathered up Mr. Bang and myself.
We walked to the rink.</p>

<p>As we entered the large, spectral building,
Ethel signed our names in a book and there
was no charge for admission, which puzzled
me. When we entered the dressing-room
there were no young rowdies about as is always
the case in our small rink at home. I
was still more at a loss to comprehend, the
situation when I noticed the boys and girls
present were all well dressed, evidently
society folk.</p>

<p>The girls were congregated in one section of
the large dressing-room, the boys in the other.
Mr. Bang, of course, went to the men’s section.
I took everything in, but still was mystified.
Ethel began changing her boots, so I did
too. My wonder growing, I whispered: “Why,
Ethel, what is this?” The new conditions
were so different from anything I had met
before.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you know? I thought you
knew. That is the Skating Club,” she whispered
in return.</p>

<p>“Oh,” I exclaimed, and I almost blurted
out—“then I shall see some society people.”
I wonder if I am really a snob! I’m afraid—</p>

<p>We left the dressing-room and descended to
the ice. The immense, arched roof was studded
with electric lights. This then was the
Skating Club about which I had so often read
in the society columns of our paper at home.</p>

<p>At first I skated into a corner with Ethel,
and watched the others. The ice was covered
with boys and girls, men and women, practising
fancy figures: some were evidently adepts,
others as evidently less expert. A few found
partners and went off in a way I had never
seen before. I watched and waited. Mr.
Bang skated up and chatted with Ethel. I
kept my eye on a girl dressed in green velvet,
who with her partner, was performing wonders.
All this was new to me and—enchanting!</p>

<p>My dream was suddenly broken; the band
struck up and almost every man sought a partner
and away they went in the waltz, actually
waltzing on ice. Mr. Bang came up and asked
if I waltzed. I replied that I didn’t. This
avowal might under other circumstances have
caused me pain.</p>

<p>He and Ethel then went to skate, but were
evidently not as good skaters as the majority
present. Ethel particularly, did not seem to
have mastered the art. She and Jack did not
seem to skate so smoothly and confidently as
the others. But how I envied the girl in
green: I was fascinated by her, enthralled.</p>

<p>The band stopped, and I sighed; my friends
came back to me.</p>

<p>“You must learn to waltz, Little Partner,”
Mr. Bang remarked kindly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied without enthusiasm. I
did not relish having Ethel hear me addressed
as “Little Partner,” though she seemed neither
shocked nor amused. I would positively
have disliked the girl in green to have been a
witness.</p>

<p>“Ethel, who is that girl in green?” I had to
ask.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t she skate beautifully—that’s
Mabel Lien.”</p>

<p>“Mabel Lien! She does,” I sighed. I
thought of her grandfather and mine, the disparity
between the girl in green and myself;
she sought after, petted and pampered, in fine
plumage: and me—! For two pins I’d be a
socialist.</p>

<p>A young man came up and engaged Ethel
for the next band. He was introduced to me
and then they went away skating, hand in
hand. So Mr. Bang and I were left together.
He amused himself by twirling away at figures,
while I resumed my reverie.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang asked me to try and skate with
him. We tried and failed. I was counted a
good skater among the girls at home. I asked
my cavalier who Mabel Lien had for a partner,
and was told, “Polly Townsend.” Polly!</p>

<p>Then Ethel came back with her companion,
who asked if I waltzed. On answering no, he
said, “So sorry,” lifted his cap and skated
away. No person asked Ethel for the succeeding
“band”—as they call it—so she kindly
tried to teach me the waltz while Mr. Bang
secured one of the few dowdy girls present,
and went away. Ethel may not be a social
figure, but is certainly unselfish and kind. I
must remember that.</p>

<p>She explained the strokes I should master,
and said I should practise with Mr. Bang. Mr.
Bang! I’m sick of Mr. Bang. I asked Ethel
if any of the good skaters ever asked her to
skate and she replied they did not. When I
asked her if she knew any of them, she
answered “Nearly all.” I do not know what
to make of this. I hope I did not hurt Ethel’s
feelings. Anyhow it is funny.</p>

<p>Ethel pointed out to me Doris Mount, who
did not skate at all well, not nearly as well as
she herself did. Polly Townsend was then
skating with her. I suppose Polly finds it
convenient to do the polite to her; while no
person found it necessary to be polite to Ethel;
and as for myself I might as well have been
“not present.”</p>

<p>One person, at any rate, was pleased with
Doris Mount—her mother sat on the promenade
and leaning on the rail glued her eyes on
her daughter. She was alone, so I left the ice
and walked to where she sat. Her greeting
was not cordial; but I seated myself beside
her, deciding to await her humour. I was
pleased to consider her abstracted; she kept
dangling her muff over the ice.</p>

<p>At last I exclaimed, “Oh! Mrs. Mount,”—the
exclamation was in the idea of leading her
to thinking I was suddenly visited by an inspiration
from the Heavens. Of course this
was in imitation of Mumsie’s greeting when
she stopped Mrs. Mount on the street. “I
have remembered what you said about meeting
only nice people, so I have decided to ask
you to introduce me, will you?”</p>

<p>“Who brought you here?” she asked
abruptly and coldly. I felt snubbed: but my
blood was up.</p>

<p>I would have answered “Ethel Bassett”,
but realized that the inference she would draw
would be hardly fair to Ethel, so I answered,
“Mr. Bang,” feeling a martyr as I did so.</p>

<p>“But he is not a member,” she objected.</p>

<p>There was nothing for it, so I said: “And
Miss Bassett.”</p>

<p>“Humph,” she snorted, “I don’t know
really: the Bassett girl can’t do anything for
you, her father is an old fogey and the mother
has no go. They have no money;” reflectively
and then more good naturedly, “well all
right,” and kept on dangling her muff while
she turned her eyes for a moment on me. I
cannot say I was proud of myself. As I write
this for my own eyes, I confess I am ashamed
of myself. However!</p>

<p>The band stopped, the waltz was ended and
up skated Doris and Polly. I was introduced
to them. “Ask her for a band,” Mrs. Mount
commanded Polly, “and ask Jerry Davidson
and Leith MacKenzie to be introduced and
to give her a band. Doris, my dear, you look
lovely to-night. Yes, really!”</p>

<p>Doris beamed, while Polly replied:</p>

<p>“Really, Mrs. Mount, I’m engaged every
band; you know I always skate the fifth with
Doris.”</p>

<p>“Well, give the girl a show; ask MacKenzie.”
Both Mr. MacKenzie and Mr. Davidson
were therefore brought up and introduced.
The latter had all his bands engaged and the
smile he wore as he announced the fact was
very complacent. I hated him for it, but hid
my wrath. Mr. MacKenzie asked me for the
seventh band.</p>

<p>“You are very kind, thank you, Mrs.
Mount,” I whispered, when the others had
departed. “It must be so nice to be able to
command kindness for strangers. I’ve heard
Uncle speak so loudly (it was no lie for
Uncle did speak loudly whenever he discussed
Mrs. Mount) of your goodness.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with a penetrating gaze,
and then smiled as she returned to contemplate
her daughter. However, she added after
a few minutes—it was kind of her on the
whole. “Now, my dear, you’ll have to learn
to skate, if you want the boys to give you
bands. Look how beautifully my Doris glides
over the shimmering ice.”</p>

<p>The ice was not shimmering, but weather-stained
and dull, and Doris skated abominably—by
comparison with the other girls.</p>

<p>“Your daughter is very beautiful, more
beautiful even than her skating,” I commented.
I don’t seem to be able to lie with all
the assurance I would wish, but my untruthfulness
was sufficient.</p>

<p>“Do you know, really, I think she is. How
long is your stay in town?” Mrs. Mount’s
voice was kinder still.</p>

<p>“A month or six weeks, Mumsie—Mrs.
Somers—asked me for. I should like to live
in the city always. So many nice people are
to be met in the city.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount swung her muff for another
minute, and then she said:</p>

<p>“You are a sensible little girl. I have a
great mind—”</p>

<p>She paused as if she felt she was liable to
say too much. I waited expectantly, eagerly.
What was in her mind, what idea was then
being discreetly curbed? I could not help but
feel she was thinking of taking me under her
wing.</p>

<p>There was nothing I could say or do, no
prompting I could give, to consolidate her
ideas into words. I could only guess. I felt
very much as one feels on hearing of a great
treasure at the bottom of the sea. It would
do Mrs. Mount no harm to give me an opportunity
of making friends.</p>

<p>The sixth band came to an end and Doris
with her partner, and others, came again to
her mother. I took no part in the chattering
—for I was yet in doubt as to what had been
in Mrs. Mount’s mind and now was likely
never to know.</p>

<p>The seventh band struck up, and MacKenzie
came for me. We skated away but I told
him I could not waltz, so we practised in a
corner. He has a funny little face, with a
pointed nose, the skin covering of which is
tight and transparent. His mouth twitched
when he intended to smile and his speech was
affected. He followed one question with another.
He professed not to know anything of
Mumsie or Uncle, and when I inadvertently
mentioned Mr. Bang, his jaw dropped. At the
end of the band he skated hurriedly away. A
nice man!</p>

<p>Soon I hinted to Ethel that I should be glad
to go home and she agreed, so we changed our
footgear and went. As we passed Mrs. Mount
I whispered: “Thank you very much for the
introduction, Mrs. Mount. I enjoyed myself
immensely.”</p>

<p>On the way home I allowed Ethel to monopolize
Mr. Bang. They got on well together
and seemed to be talking earnestly. But my
mind was full of thought. I have decided to
make a bold venture. I have, I realize, minted
my self-respect; and am doling it out coin
upon coin. As yet, I must own to myself, the
returns have been nil; no pleasure—rather
chagrin: no gratification—rather depression.
But still! I’m afraid I’m self-conscious in the
presence of Ethel or Mr. Bang. Not that it
makes much difference if either of them
judges the import of my actions. But let me
hope that, after I’ve paid, and paid, and paid,
that I shall some day realize my happiness.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 24th.</span></span></p>

<p>Christmas Eve! I woke this morning with
a new fund of spirits—I’m glad to say. I
went off into the city to see the crowds. Mr.
Bang accompanied me. He said he had a
business engagement. We parted in the
business section.</p>

<p>I know all the streets now, or most of them,
and can find my way about nicely. I did not
meet any of my friends, or anybody I knew.
While pleasant and interesting, it was an uneventful
morning.</p>

<p>Shortly after my return Mr. Bang arrived
carrying a bundle which proved to contain a
quantity of evergreen wreathing. This he
dumped on the drawing-room floor, remarking:
“You may help me decorate this afternoon,
Little Partner.”</p>

<p>After lunch we set to work, festooning the
chandeliers and picture frames, and soon I
became absorbed in the effort—and in Mr.
Bang’s conversation. For the time being I
forgot society and found myself laughing
quite merrily. In fact, I confess I was thoroughly
happy.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang, like Uncle, has a tendency to run
off into long, confidential dissertations. He
began to talk about himself, and I was interested.
I will try and reproduce what he said
in his own words. He is rather fond of long
words, which sometimes are ponderous.</p>

<p>“I’m engaged in driving a tunnel on the Rat
River Railway; MacDonald, who is my partner,
and I have the contract. This will keep
us going for months. It is an important piece
of work and he is here negotiating for it.
There is plenty of red-tape in the way, so I
am likely to be here a tolerable time. Shall
you be glad?”</p>

<p>Fancy asking me that question! “I shall
be glad if you have a good time,” I said
cautiously.</p>

<p>“There is no reason you should be glad if I
stay, so far as I can see,” he said frankly. “I
asked the question simply out of interest in
your reply. May I confess that I take an
interest in my ‘Little Partner,’ and am
anxious to learn if society is spoiling her? She
is too good to be spoiled.” He looked at me
as if he were looking through me.</p>

<p>“Why?” I demanded, startled by the trend
of his conversation.</p>

<p>“You have a conscience and—you have a
heart.”</p>

<p>“I!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” and again this man’s serious eyes
were upon me. Evidently he saw through my
motives last night. I thought of last night, of
Ethel Bassett’s goodness to me and my mental
attitude towards her—and the humiliation
attending my talk with Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid—” I began, and faltered, not
quite knowing what to say.</p>

<p>“The fact that you’re afraid shows you have
a conscience.”</p>

<p>“Do you like the West?” I asked, to change
the conversation.</p>

<p>“The West! I love the West. British
Columbia is the best province in Canada; the
climate the best, the scenery the grandest, the
people the nicest.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oh!” I laughed.</p>

<p>“But, of course, my ideas of nice people
are different from those of say, Mrs. Mount.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” I said, somewhat mischievously.
He went on:</p>

<p>“Many of us were poor when we went West,
but the thing is that we’re cosmopolitan and
have formed the habit of looking below the
surface of things. Remember that! The
social side of life out West is different from
the East. So are the people. Here the fellows
are all the same; were you to throw a dozen
fellows into a sack and heave them about, the
product of one grab from the bag would be
the same as another. You could not tell them
apart, all with the same narrow views of life.”
Mr. Bang then suddenly changed his tone,
“I’m ready to admit the fellows here have as
much right to hate me as I have to hate them.”</p>

<p>“You hate them, hate the East?”</p>

<p>“I hate the East, or rather the hollowness
and shallowness of its people, their snobbery,
their affectations, silly emulation, mean ambitions
and limitations; their patronizing impertinences.”</p>

<p>The delivery of this weighty charge relieved
him, for he smiled and proposed a walk.</p>

<p>At dinner I talked of my Skating Club experiences,
Uncle opening the way by asking
how I had enjoyed myself. I replied, “Nicely,
thank you,” and followed up with the announcement
that I had met Polly Townsend,
Mr. MacKenzie, and Mr. Davidson.</p>

<p>“Ah, so you met Polly Townsend. That
was an experience. What did you think of
him?”</p>

<p>“I liked him, that is, I think I do, though
he did not skate with me. I really———”</p>

<p>“Polly would be a profitable study, if you
are seriously interested in such folk. A study
of such insects is helpful to establishing an
entomological view of society.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “he is the best skater——”</p>

<p>“Pooh! His skating is the least interesting
phase of Polly. He is the expression of modern
social finesse. He has no brains, no manners,
save those that are bad, no money——”</p>

<p>“No money! then that discredits the theory
that wealth is necessary in society,” I sang
out.</p>

<p>“Therein lies whatever genius the man
possesses,” exclaimed Uncle with glee. “Polly
has a wealth of impertinence, of self-assurance,
and conceit. By birth he should be a
gentleman, but a gentleman’s instincts he
lacks. Whatever he does, he does well,—tennis,
golf, skating. Even his self-adulation
is masterly. But of the things that really
matter he is a futility. He can be ineffably
rude, insolent, contemptible through his contemptuousness.”</p>

<p>“From this one may gather———”</p>

<p>“That the snub is an effective lever with
weak human nature. We are jealous of our
sensibilities and guard them. When social
exigencies compel us to approach such as
Polly, we lift our hat to the conqueror. The
only self-respecting way to treat Polly is to
leave him alone; but because of his success in
sport, at the golf club, and so on, Polly is an
unavoidable evil.”</p>

<p>“Poor Polly?” I dared to ask, as Uncle
closed his long speech.</p>

<p>“His chin goes in,” he rejoindered, as if he
enjoyed it, “his forehead goes back, his nose
is squash, and his voice resembles—as you suggest—that
of ‘Poor Poll’.”</p>

<p>I realized the resemblance.</p>

<p>“And Mr. Davidson?”</p>

<p>“Davidson? Merely a snob—only that and
nothing more.”</p>

<p>“Mr. MacKenzie?”</p>

<p>“A monstrosity,” spoke up Mr. Bang, “yet
he taught me a good lesson.”</p>

<p>“How could Mr. MacKenzie teach you a
lesson?” I exclaimed laughingly, although I
couldn’t help emphasizing the “you.” The
emphasis was, however, apparently quite lost
on Mr. Bang. His composure and gravity
were serene, as he replied:</p>

<p>“Once in early youth I came to this city
and hoped to become a member of a tennis
club to which MacKenzie belonged. I knew
Mac and schemed to improve our acquaintance
in order to help me in. I invited him to lunch,
filled him with wine, attempted to talk on
literature, and finally told him I was a tennis
enthusiast.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang paused, and Uncle asked mischievously:</p>

<p>“Did he respond?”</p>

<p>“He responded by asking if he might insure
my life.”</p>

<p>We roared, that is, save Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“That was a cold douche which drowned my
social ambitions. I reasoned that society that
would tolerate such a Yahoo as he had nothing
to offer worth having.”</p>

<p>“The girls laugh at him,” said Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” replied Mr. Bang, who began to
unburden himself further.</p>

<p>“The trouble with most of our sports is that
they are, as Uncle says, communal and in the
hands of devotees who build them up. Cliques
are formed which such people as Townsend
and MacKenzie run. Golf is somewhat the
exception to this general rule, which possibly
accounts for the ever increasing popularity of
the game. Golf clubs, generally, make provisions
for the admittance of strangers, and, for
some reason or other, good-fellowship is more
common in golf clubs than in other associations.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” commented Uncle.</p>

<p>“I generally tell people whom I meet casually,”
continued Mr. Bang, “that I have
navvied and mined throughout the West,
especially if they suggest themselves to me as
being a bit snobbish, and I often find myself
treated as a tough character. I do this merely
to be honest. I daresay this is a mistake, for
people ascribe my candour to simplicity.”</p>

<p>“What do you do with the tenderfoot when
he arrives in the West?” I asked Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“We treat him well and give him a show. If
he is loaded with nonsense we kindly knock it
out of him.”</p>

<p>Was there ever a stranger character than
this Mr. Bang? In spite of my dislike for
him, I am becoming interested.</p>

<p>“The westerner’s quarrel with the easterner
is not unique,” put in Uncle as his nephew
ceased speaking. “It is the same with the
Englishman who returns home from Australia
or Rhodesia. Frontier communities are
made up of wanderers; and its social life
frames itself to suit the scallywag. Settled
communities have no experience in such wanderers,
and their prejudices are strong.”</p>

<p>Uncle made this explanation dispassionately,
as if he simply wished to further my
understanding. I suppose I am still a child
in my knowledge of the world. But I’m
cleverer than they seem to think. Men are
self-satisfied creatures, sometimes.</p>

<p>After dinner we went into the city, walked
into the crowded streets. Sleighbells were
ringing, here, there, and everywhere. Sleighbells
are almost the jolliest thing about Christmas;
the automobile horns sounded out of
place. There was a great deal of laughing and
of merry greetings to be heard.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang is certainly prodigal with his
money. He gave a poor boy a dollar and told
him to buy a new shirt; and he gave a poor,
old woman two dollars. He did not do it
secretly, nor ostentatiously, but in an open-hearted,
matter-of-course sort of way. I suppose
it is the result of his western training.</p>

<p>But if Mr. Bang hates eastern society, I confess
the more I see of its movement and brightness,
the more I intend to get on. The way
will open—I know that—and I am quite rid
of the queer ideas that filled my mind last
night. I can make use of Mr. Bang and Ethel
Bassett, and possibly—Mrs. Mount, “that old
battle-axe,” who is more like, shall I say, a
Fairy Godmother. Possibly, we’ll see.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>Christmas Day.</span></span></p>

<p>Such a heavenly day, sunshine with ice
crystals, no wind.</p>

<p>Mumsie came into my room at peep of
dawn, carrying a bundle. There was a letter
in it from Dad enclosing another hundred dollars
for me to spend. Dear old Dad! And
then there was a parcel marked, “From Jack
to his Little Partner.” I undid the fastenings
and there were four shaggy, hairy skins. I
could not make out what they were. And a
pair of gloves from Mumsie—women always
give gloves. I tried on the gloves and Mumsie
suggested that we go to early service.</p>

<p>I jumped out of bed and as I dressed looked
at the furs,—I had never seen anything like
them, so brown and glossy. What sort of an
animal could they have belonged to?</p>

<p>I went downstairs and saw a fire burning
in the den and two men standing before it—Uncle
and Jack. So I entered the room, and
a cheery voice greeted me with “Merry Christmas!”
and Uncle gathered me in his arms and
kissed me. Mr. Bang, rather dolefully echoed:
“Merry Christmas!” It struck me as strange
that Uncle had not given me a present, even
if only a handkerchief. I shook hands with
Mr. Bang and said, “Thank you very much
for the skins.”</p>

<p>“They’re nothing,” he replied almost indifferently.
“Uncle is going to have them made
into a muff and collar for you as his present.
I got the skins from an Indian. You see,”
continued he in his usual tone, “the British
Columbia government has shut down on the
destruction of beaver for a number of years
to save these animals from becoming extinct,
and it is against the law to have the skins in
one’s possession.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I exclaimed, “then you ran chances
of being fined for my sake. How good you
are!”</p>

<p>“No, not so good, as I did not know of your
existence at the time, and could hardly have
been concerned with that. What I mean is
that they did not cost me much. As the animals
were already dead my conscience did not
trouble me and I took particular pains to give
such small value for the skins, that I don’t
fancy the noble red man will think it worth
his while to break the law again.”</p>

<p>I do not know how to describe the manner
of address used by Mr. Bang to me and I have
borrowed Uncle’s dictionary to help me out.
“Didactic” will hardly do, nor will “pedantic.”
Perhaps “patronizing” is the only term
that I can apply to it, but then “patronizing”
is not quite just. Of course, Uncle is equally
guilty at times, but only at times; and I love
Uncle. And if I am to have a complete set of
furs at their hands, I can forgive much! Perhaps
“elderly” or “condescending” is the
word: but it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p>But were Mr. Bang and Uncle serious.
Beaver!—I have seen beaver, soft, grey, delicate
fur, and this is bristling like a porcupine
almost. So I thought I would begin a question
and then stammer. If I laughed prettily, I
could appear innocent: and I did so successfully,
though there is often a doubtful, pitying
look in Jack’s quizzical, grey eyes.</p>

<p>“Oh! Uncle do tell me, are beavers ever born
with—with—Oh, I don’t know—something
like—first cousin—Porcupine—long hairs—”</p>

<p>“Oh,” laughed Uncle, while Mr. Bang grinned
broadly, “You are troubled over the
shaggy appearance of the skins. They have
not been plucked—the long coarse hairs are
generally plucked from the beaver, otter, fur
seal, and a few others, when the fur remaining
is soft and silky.”</p>

<p>“And I may have mine made into real
beaver—how lovely!”</p>

<p>“I would suggest,” put in Mr. Bang, still
smiling, “that you leave them as they are, they
would become you and not be unfashionable.”</p>

<p>“Would they?” I asked, impetuously turning
to Uncle.</p>

<p>“As Jack suggests, I think they would be
becoming,” and Uncle smiled. “You can
always trust Jack.”</p>

<p>“Then I shall,” I said and left them. I
meant leave the skins as they were, and if they
thought I meant trusting Jack that is their
look-out.</p>

<p>After breakfast I saw Bowman, the man
who tends Uncle’s furnace and clears away the
snow, passing out into the street with a cigar
box under his arm. I was sure it was the box
I gave Uncle. I thought I would investigate
so I went into the den where the two men were
smoking. They were enjoying cigars, the
odour of which seemed fine.</p>

<p>“Oh Uncle!” I cried, “I’m so glad to find
you smoking. I noticed Bowman with a cigar
box under his arm and I wondered——”</p>

<p>“Bowman takes such things as empty cigar
boxes as his perquisites, see!”—and Uncle
took a jar off the mantle and removing the
cover showed me many cigars. Both of them
then laughed. I was very annoyed.</p>

<p>Whenever I am in Mr. Bang’s presence he
gazes intently at me and I am beginning to
loathe his quiet smile. Nothing escapes him,
and after Uncle’s explanation I’m sure he saw
me start as I noticed a half consumed cigar
box in the grate. Evidently there were the
contents of two boxes of cigars in the jar.</p>

<p>In any case I won’t trouble my head about
what Uncle did with my cigars. I dislike men
very much sometimes.</p>

<p>Dinner came at four and Mumsie had the
table looking like a dream, such a sparkle of
glass and silver, setting off the roses and carnations
nicely. And the holly and mistletoe,
which over-shadowed the lamp, and the bon-bons,—the
crackers lying on each napkin! Oh,
it was delicious! I may say heavenly.</p>

<p>Mumsie was at her brightest, looking the
picture of Christmas geniality. Uncle, too,
was particularly kind as he welcomed us to the
feast. Someway, I was impressed that all and
everything were for me. All Uncle’s pleasantries
were addressed to me or for my benefit.
I believe Uncle is becoming fond of me.</p>

<p>His good nature seemed also to affect Mr.
Bang, who told us stories of his own, wild life,
and incidents in the lives of others; and in his
calm way he can be very humorous. Then he
told of the many strange circumstances under
which he had eaten his Christmas dinner—in
camps, in towns and cities, in hotels, in homes,
in log cabins, even under canvas. And then I
noticed his mouth draw into a smile, as he
fixed his eyes on his wine glass which he kept
absently turning.</p>

<p>“What have you in your mind, Jack?” asked
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“I was thinking of the only Christmas dinner
I ever ate away from friends or acquaintances
and how in this case, I met poor Tom
Dahlmun. It was in Dawson City, Christmas,
1900—”</p>

<p>“Tell us of it,” demanded Uncle.</p>

<p>“You never told us how you came to go to
the Klondike,” said Mumsie; “Please tell us
about it.”</p>

<p>“To tell you how I came to go to the Klondike
and my adventures in getting there
would be a longer story than you would care
to listen to,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Do, do tell us all about it,” I cried eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, I will abstain from frills, and try
and not weary you.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do that,” I said with assurance.</p>

<p>“With your permission, Auntie, I shall in
my telling of my adventures affect the manner
of the miner at his camp-fire. Now and
again I may mention details that appear inconsequent.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, go on!”</p>

<p>“Well, about September, 1900, I was at
Skagway on the Alaskan Coast without money,
and with no prospect of profitable employment.</p>

<p>“The Canadian Customs at Skagway gave
me short jobs, but by the end of the month
they petered out and I was faced with the
necessity of finding means even for food.</p>

<p>“There seemed no alternative but to go
south. But I harboured the idea of going to
Dawson and some fiend nourished it. No
more quixotic plan can ever have entered the
mind of man, but I went.</p>

<p>“I crossed to White Horse, the port on the
Upper Yukon River. The thermometer had
sunk below zero, though the weather was mild.
I spent some days figuring ways and means of
carrying out my mad idea, and spent more
dollars than I could afford. I shall always
maintain that friendships struck up in a bar-room
are productive of nothing but losses
and waste of time.</p>

<p>“Possibly I was inspired with a blind faith
in fortune or I didn’t care a ——— button.
Somebody suggested I should try and work
my way on one of the steamers. I tried and
failed. A good thing too, for I would have
earned little or no money that way and been
landed five hundred miles nearer the north
pole, and so much further from civilization.</p>

<p>“Then came the voice of destiny; a man
called from a scow tied to the dock: ‘Do you
want to go to Dawson? Give you seven and a
half dollars per day.’ ‘All right,’ said I.</p>

<p>“The wage was high, which is an indication
that travel was not northwards. The weather
turned wonderfully mild, considering the
recent exploits of the thermometer, and the
sun shone brightly as we set out to the unknown.
Only one of us had been down that
river before.</p>

<p>“I was one of a party of six and our craft
consisted of two scows lashed together. Each
scow contained twenty tons of freight, and
three thousand two hundred dollars was to be
paid for transporting this to Dawson. My
companions consisted of the four owners and
a chap who was working his passage to his
camp down the river, where he was engaged
chopping wood for sale to the river steamers.</p>

<p>“One of the owners was a Yankee, two were
Scotch-Canadians, and one was a Swede. The
Yankee had worked all summer as deck-hand
on a river steamer and so had knowledge of
the currents. One of the Scotchmen was a
Salvation Army man and the other just old
Mac. The Swede was a decent fellow. All
but the Yankee were straight-forward. He,
Alec, would never look one in the face, and
was of a nature soft and unassertive. I should
have felt more comfortable with him had he
occasionally lost his temper and sworn a bit.
His only qualification was his knowledge of
the river.</p>

<p>“I soon gathered the business details. The
four owners had built one scow and tried to
sell it, but, through the lateness of the season
and difficulty in getting men to man it, were
unable to dispose of it. So they purchased
another scow and essayed to get their money
out of both by contracting to deliver freight
in Dawson.</p>

<p>“The joy of such a trip is the scenery; and
then the appetite one is blessed with! Our
trip through the Thirty Mile was somewhat
remarkable. This river is a part of the Upper
Yukon, and has caused more wrecks than any
other portion of the great waterway.</p>

<p>“It was strewn with wrecks of scows which
had tried to get through in the day time. We
went through at night for the good and sufficient
reason that we could not stop.</p>

<p>“The Thirty Mile is very swift, and our
Pilot was reluctant to tie up any sooner than
was absolutely necessary. In fact, on this
occasion it was I who made the suggestion
that we moor to the bank ere darkness had
completely come.</p>

<p>“Strange to say my advice was acted upon;
the pilot grabbed a rope and ordered the scows
to be diverted towards the left bank. Then
he made a spring, landed, and sought a tree to
which he might tie up. There was none, but
rather a world of fallen brush. The scows
were moving at better than six miles per hour,
and with the result that the pilot, trying in
vain to keep up with us, was forced to let go
the rope. There was only one thing to do, and
that was for somebody on the scows to take
the dingey we had with us and row back for
our mate. This was done with the result that
the scows were left with four men only to
manage them. The gloom settled over us and
the shores were dimly visible, while we swept
down the canyon. A heavily-laden scow
travels faster than the current that bears it.
This explains how we obtained a good lead on
the dingey. The light then failed, and the only
thing visible was the reflection of the sky on
the water. I began to give orders, or, I had
better say, make suggestions. I became frightened
of leaving the dingey altogether, or of
coming to other calamities, so I told my fellows
I would attempt to tie up the scows. Our
shouts to the pilot and his rescuer brought
response from both up and down the river.
There was evidently a scow safely moored
below us. Hastily we shouted our trouble, and
the crew of the moored scow said we might tie
to them. Frantically we worked to get the
scows across the current for they were tied to
the right bank; it was no use, we passed them.
But the impetus we gained was carrying us
into the right bank. Vaguely I saw the shadows,
jumped, and landed up to my hips in
water. I scrambled ashore and ran into a wall
of rock. The rope I held tightened, and I followed
its lead along the face of the rock till I
went in to my middle; and then I, too, let go
the rope.</p>

<p>“In due time, the boat picked me up and we
set out in pursuit of the scows. We gained
on them; finally gathering from the shouting
that the woodcutter had gained the shore, had
thrice snubbed the scows and the scows three
times pulled a tree up by the roots. So Alec
shouted to let the scows drift. We pulled the
woodcutter into the boat and then regained the
scows.</p>

<p>“The moon had risen over the canyon and
light and shadow, glimmering water and
sparkling skies, ranged themselves in wonderful
combination, all weird, some magnificent.
I remember that besides marvelling at the
sights about me, I remarked the softness of
the air. What the thermometer was I do not
know, it could not have been much, if at all,
above freezing, yet, while I was wet to the
middle I have no recollection of being cold.</p>

<p>“In due time we floated into a great lagoon
on the shores of which was a settlement. A
dozen or so of river men and prospectors, a
gambler or two, and a couple of policemen
here had their abode.</p>

<p>“The stillness of lone lands is one of their
special features. I know I enjoyed it, and my
companions had no doubt some rude, unconscious
sympathy with the natural beauties. At
any rate, as the hoarse laughter floated across
the lagoon it sounded a discord, and hearing
it men became quiet.</p>

<p>“I have spoken of our capacity for eating.
I shall never forget the moose tenderloin
steaks we got from Indians at Little Salmon
River. The joy of eating! civilization knows
nothing like it. The best of fresh meat after
weeks of bacon!</p>

<p>“At Little Salmon River, a tributary
stream, the heavy frosts came upon us again,
and here an interesting development affected
our night’s rest. Our beds were made upon
the cargo and beneath a great tarpaulin. No
poles suspended the canvas; it lay flat against
the hay and oats that constituted our load.
The vapour arising from the comparatively
warm water in the scow, the water that would
correspond to the bilge of a ship, condensed
upon the canvas. The effect was a coating of
beautiful ice crystals, some of them an inch
long. In the daylight they showed the most
orderly system of spears and shafts, elaborate
yet exact.</p>

<p>“As we crawled to our lairs at night the
fairy-like ferns tingled joyously and fell upon
us in wintry showers. In the morning they
melted and drenched us. But we did well
enough. Between times through the night we
slept, all standing, as the sailors say, warm
and comfortable.</p>

<p>“Frost is a most powerful agent in the north
land. As you may guess, King Frost is a
term used widely and not without reason.
Indeed our passage was eminently a kindly
dispensation of the monarch. As day succeeded
day the ultimate closing of the mighty
jaws of the river drew nearer. The owners’
money, my money, all our fortunes, depended
on the absence of delays. Delays while inevitable,
humanly speaking, were still a matter of
chance. We were held at the caprice of winter.</p>

<p>“Jack Frost is indeed versatile. Not only
did he commence to throw cakes of ice in the
river, but placed a more active, if less tangible
hindrance in our way. Over the river in the
early mom a billowy, swaying, pink, yellow,
purple, orange, blue mantle of mist hung. To
guide our craft it was necessary to see, for the
Yukon’s stream has many channels, only one
of which, as a rule, is navigable for such a vessel
as ours. About us were sand bars and
islands, and to run aground meant loss of
precious time, and possibly destruction.</p>

<p>“Of course, the sun rising would in time dissipate
the fog, but while Jack Frost and he
had their morning game at tossing cloud
banks, we would lose an hour or two. As the
days went by, and we lay further towards the
arctic circle, the frost became heavier and the
daily range of temperature less marked.
About three days from our goal we ran into a
snow storm and passed a few tributaries
throwing out lumps of ice. The presence of
floating ice, however, was a blessing, because
it marked the more shallow spots and helped
us to avoid them. When the air was not filled
with snow, the skies were gray and sullen. It
was a blessing there was no wind.</p>

<p>“Our last night out from Dawson I remember
distinctly. The running ice had filled the
river. At dusk we tied up at a woodcutter’s
cabin, and learned we had fifty miles still to
go. We went to bed, under our tingling tarpaulin;
and, I remember, I lay awake just one
minute listening to the ice crashing into our
craft. Would the planks hold? A moment’s
apprehension, and then—sleep.</p>

<p>“We started again at a perilously early
hour. The ice had increased enormously during
the night. The river was ‘bank full’ as
the term is; it was a grinding, mixing lot. Had
we struck a bar the rush of ice would have
piled us on so tight we never would have got
off again. But to offset this, the shore ice had
now extended so far out that only the deepest
channels were running. We could not have
got aground if we had wanted to.</p>

<p>“At six o’clock the night had fallen; we
heard the toot of a factory whistle. Five
hundred miles behind us we had left Whitehorse,
an outpost of civilization. We had travelled
by an agency over which we had no control
five hundred miles, into a wilderness that
ranged beyond the ken of men. Here was an
oasis. A whistle, discordant at most times, was
music to us then. It sang of dangers past.</p>

<p>“But our danger was not past until we succeeded
in stopping. To be carried beyond
Dawson would be as great a calamity as to be
stranded above it. There was no difference
so far as the discharge of our cargo was concerned.</p>

<p>“The lights flashed out and a thousand times
winked welcome, irresistibly my mind fell to
playing with the fact; here was a world in
miniature and I at the heart of it.</p>

<p>“The river before Dawson is broad and
there is a deep eddy. Strangely enough the
eddy was yet unfrozen and free of ice. We
struggled into the still water and so to shore.
It took us an hour’s hard labour to get there.
It was joy to hear a friendly hand on shore
shout: ‘All fast!’</p>

<p>“We went to bed and slept as long as we
liked: a luxury. Arising, we found the world
a riot of colour. The sun was up, the air was
clear save for the steam arising from the
water, and the thermometer was twenty below
zero. Away out in mid-channel the ice-floes
still ground persistently on their way, but
round about us was ice clear, black, and resonant.
We were frozen in.”</p>

<p>Here Mr. Bang paused and looked enquiringly
at Mumsie. Uncle caught the glance
and reassured him.</p>

<p>“Go on, Jack, we’re interested.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jack, indeed we are,” added Mumsie.</p>

<p>“And my Little Partner?” asked he.</p>

<p>“Oh! I am so interested, do go on.”</p>

<p>“I was in Dawson. I had made one hundred
and ten dollars in wages on the trip down
besides twenty-five dollars, which I earned by
bringing a ballot-box in from the police post
one hundred miles up the river. Dawson had
just enjoyed its first experience of the Franchise.</p>

<p>“Had I been wise I would have stayed with
my friends, who prudently secured a cabin
and settled down for the winter. Instead of
that, I engaged a room at the principal hotel
at a cost of four dollars per day, European
plan. Meals cost a dollar and a half each.
Then instead of borrowing a hand-sled and
hauling my trunk up from the scow, as a
Dawsonite would have done, I engaged a boy
with a dog. The dog’s name, I remember, was
‘Sleepy’ and the youth charged two dollars.
The distance, be it said, was only about two
hundred yards.</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact, Dawson was at that
time remarkably free from convention and
prejudice. I had in mind to try for clerical
work from the Government. Had I been seen
hauling my trunk through the streets or,
given my address as such and such a cabin,
my chances would have been none the less,
while the dollars I might have saved would
have represented so much security against
starvation. But perhaps my risking an extravagant
bid for preferment was supported by
the knowledge that I was a Canadian in a city
in Canada, where the vast majority of the
population was alien; also I built on the hope
that as one of my life’s best friends had
formerly held high administrative office in the
country, but was then in South Africa fighting,
I might meet with particular consideration
from the authorities. I found, however,
that the dispenser of Government patronage
in Dawson was the open enemy of my friend.
So this source of interest failed.</p>

<p>“A friend of a relative spoke in my behalf
to the all-powerful head of the political
machine, and I was advised to apply. I did so.
‘How do you vote?’ he asked. I told him I
had never voted in my life, but, as he of course
knew, my people voted Tory. ‘Well,’ he replied,
‘I won’t do anything for you; we have
to get back at you fellows, you know.’ This
represents the spirit of the Grit administration
in Dawson. Those who ruled, who pulled
the wires would, and did assist, and grant
favours to Yankees in preference to political
opponents among their own people. And yet
the Grits claim they are not pro-Yankee!</p>

<p>“Somehow I made the acquaintance of the
‘old man,’ one of the most remarkable characters
in all the world. He was very strong
in religion but weak on cleanliness; a slight,
grizzled man with a stoop. He had a cabin, I
had none. I had some money, he had none.
Our duty to each other was obvious.</p>

<p>“There were eighteen hundred men starving
in Dawson that winter, yet no word was
uttered about the unemployed. Anyway,
everyway, we were putting in the winter. We—the
old man and I, we joined their ranks.</p>

<p>“The old man’s cabin was larger than usual
and divided into two compartments. It had
been badly constructed and was in very bad
repair. The larger compartment had a window.
This was our home; the other compartment
serving as wood-shed and lumber-room.</p>

<p>“The first task I set myself after I took my
residence there was to tidy up. A number of
filthy old rags which I threw into the lumber-room
turned out to be the old man’s ‘clothes.’
He was mortally offended.</p>

<p>“The weather was intensely cold, and in our
happy home a bucket of water froze solid in
a night. On waking in the morning we would
find our blankets glued together by our frozen
breath. I spilt some water accidentally on
the floor in December, and the consequent
sheet of ice lasted until February. Our stove
was small and of tin; it sat in a corner. The
fact that numerous holes in the chinking
allowed the wind to enter, together with our
very limited supply of wood, and the smallness
of the stove, accounted for the coldness
of the cabin. We had to haul our own wood
from three miles down river, and what we
then obtained was poor, as one day’s work
would secure only three days’ supply.</p>

<p>“We used to arise at eleven and cook porridge.
The old man would prepare it, always
of course, after his way. I never summoned
up courage to cook it my way. He would bring
the water to a boil and then dump in enough
oatmeal to drink up the water. The meal was
never boiled and came out with the consistency
of mortar. Nor was any salt added; the old
man did not believe salt was good for the system.
He said if the meal were boiled it would
become sticky. This disgusting mess was
invariably our breakfast. If our dishes were
washed, even over long periods, it was I who
did it. Of course, there was really no danger
in leaving the dishes dirty, for they froze
immediately and ill effects were thereby prevented.</p>

<p>“After breakfast we went down town; the
old man generally to the Free Library, and I
to the gambling saloons, or the shop of a merchant
I knew, and then to the library. At six
we would come home, cook and eat the heavy
meal of the day. It consisted generally of
bacon and beans, the bacon of questionable
quality. Then we would travel into town
again, returning to our cabin at midnight for
supper and bed. Supper generally was a
repetition of breakfast. Once indeed, I suggested
making some slap-jacks and was
allowed to carry the idea into effect. We both
ate and the old man was laid up next day.
Towards evening he managed to disgorge the
mass and having a scientific mind, he enquired
into it. He found the dough completely undigested.
This has always been a wonder to me
for I had no trouble with my meal and have
always had a weak digestion, whereas the old
man had the digestion of an ostrich.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what a student of hygiene
would say to our diet and mode of life, but I
can say my powers of digestion were never
better. And our general mode of life was out
of the ordinary. We never took our clothes
off in going to bed. I must confess, however,
that I sometimes took a bath and changed my
underclothing. When I announced my intention
of spending a dollar on a bath, the old
man would sadly shake his head. Not that he
objected to what I did with my money, but
rather that he looked upon that expenditure
as an insane waste.</p>

<p>“On Christmas day I did not seek out the old
man. His philosophy was not satisfied with
Christmas—although he was a great churchman.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the luxury of a dinner, a special
turkey dinner, costing me a dollar and a half.
I entered the Northern Annex, being the
restaurant connected with one of the leading
gambling saloons of the city, sat down, and a
plate of soup was slammed in front of me. I
let it be and gazed about me. I was the only
one rejoicing in a table to myself. About me
were ranged human hulks and derelicts, most
of them in pea-jackets, some with fur collars
turned above their ears.</p>

<p>“As I sat musing, a man sat down at my
side. His features were good, that is, they
were regular. They might have been handsome
had their lines been a little stronger,
as it was they lacked colour. I tendered a few
commonplace civilities and had them returned.
I remarked on the weather; so did he. I said
‘I have been reviewing all the Christmases I
have memory of’. ‘We all do it, a distressing
process.’ ‘Think of the great range of Christendom,’
I said. ‘Is it not well to think that
you and I are the exceptions? What joy has
England had to-day and Anglo-Saxon America;
a joy that would be enhanced did the
partakers but view us as we sit and so by contrast
establish a fitting measure of their own
good fortune.’ This was of course off at a
tangent, but I wished to draw him out.</p>

<p>“ ‘I have had my mind occupied with my
own Christmases my mind travelling over
time rather than geography,’ he said.</p>

<p>“ ‘It is weird, is it not; from the nuts and
candies in the stocking hung for Santa Claus
and devoured ere the mornings light had well
broken, to the well-laid table and the maiden
kissed beneath the mistletoe at later hours in
later years?’ I’m afraid my advances were
hardly tactful and my conversation was
rather stilted; but if these were so I was evidently
forgiven, for my companion replied:</p>

<p>“ ‘With me but two Christmases outstand,
that of 1907, and the following Christmas.
Widely different as they may be I do not know
which will live the longer in my memory.’</p>

<p>“The expression of his face told me he was
suffering, and I essayed no further remark.
Expectantly I waited. ‘Christmas 1908, I
spent at Wind City,’ he said. The very name
told of horror, Wind City being the place
where a number of adventurers had wintered
two years before. It is a name at which the
strong men who know shudder.</p>

<p>“ ‘I spent the day digging a grave for the
best Pal a man ever had. The tools I used I
bought in England, fondly picturing the
wealth they would win me.’</p>

<p>“He knew the simple facts would convey to
me the story of the grave that covers the body
of the one and the heart of the other. As we
ate the food that had been served us, I watched
my companion’s face and while no twitching
disturbed its calm I knew, something told me,
the desire to unburden his mind was strong
in him.</p>

<p>“He told me of that last Christmas day at
home; of old mater who had caught the spirit
and shared his optimism. To them the Klondike
was—as to all of us—the Promised Land.
And there was the girl steady and trusting;
the kind that will go through fire and water
for her man. She was penniless. You know
the old story. ‘Behold the sequel!’ he said of
a sudden.” As he spoke Mr. Bang’s face was
full of sympathy.</p>

<p>“So ended our dinner. Such too often is
life.</p>

<p>“I frequently met Tom Dahlmun afterwards
and we became friendly. One day I
learned of work at Gold Run Creek, forty-five
miles from Dawson, and engaged employment
for two.</p>

<p>“Tom and I made an appointment to set
out on foot for the scene of our labours. He
did not turn up on time; I waited, then went
on alone. The next thing I heard he was dead.
He had gone to work on Hold Hill and had
died of spinal meningitis; but I guess his
malady was sheer want. Many a good man
has starved. These are hardly thoughts for
Christmas.”</p>

<p>We all remained silent.</p>

<p>“This little story of poor Tom has no more
moral than that. My only justification for
telling it is that when I’m particularly happy
at Christmas, it always comes to mind there
are so many good fellows just like Tom.”</p>

<p>“It was a strange spirit,” went on Mr.
Bang, “that animated Dawson’s legion, an
unreasonable, unwise spirit; yet not without
beauty. Many of the starving host could have
had credit from the merchants, yet they refrained
from asking it. Personal pride
restrained them. They were good business
risks and they knew it. With the return of
summer, gold would come from the creeks
and wages would be high; yet these rough
diamonds of fellows would not run the risk
lest fortune’s hazardous there, should intervene
and prevent their settling.”</p>

<p>And that was the end of Mr. Bang’s narrative,
which made me think.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 26th.</span></span></p>

<p>I have had such a time writing Mr. Bang’s
narrative, hours last night and hours to-day.
For one thing this writing keeps me from being
a burden on Mumsie. Uncle says there
will be nothing doing in society between
Christmas and the New Year. I wonder why
he said this.</p>

<p>Last night as I lay in bed I thought of many
things. I certainly don’t wish to go West,
where the manhood is of the type of Mr. Bang.
Too rough! Too unrefined! This is my world
in the East, a gentleworld, where the men instead
of struggling for rude wealth, help the
girls to enjoy themselves. I must get into
society; I’m determined on that. I won’t be
put off by Jack’s or Uncle’s prejudices, but I
must act discreetly, even covertly. I must
make friends with Mrs. Mount and her set. I
know such things can be done. Uncle gave
me a hint when he said excellence in sport was
a qualification. How am I to learn to skate,
to waltz? Mr. Bang must teach me.</p>

<p>So this morning, notwithstanding it was
Sunday, I started a discussion by saying I
wished to learn to waltz. The upshot was as
I hoped—Mr. Bang offered to take me skating
at Badger Lake.</p>

<p>The cars took us there. The small boy was
much in evidence, but this had its compensation
in that it lessened the probability of any
nice people being there and seeing me with my
cavalier. I know this would sound to another
extremely snobbish, but I realize that, as Mr.
Bang has been a visitor to this city a number
of times, and has not been taken up, my
chances will be lessened if I am seen too much
with him. If Mr. Bang is an example of
manly virtue, if he lacks “side” and affectation,
and is guiltless of all those foibles he and
Uncle condemn in others, I can’t say much for
his success socially.</p>

<p>He was very kind and quite a proficient
teacher, and I believe I made progress.</p>

<p>I have told Mumsie I am writing a book
and told her not to tell anybody at all, on her
word of honour and all that. This minimizes
the chances of discovery by the men folk.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 27th.</span></span></p>

<p>This morning at breakfast Uncle passed me
over the portion of the paper which contains
the social news. As he did so, his face wore
a teasing smile and his eyes twinkled. I was
unable to with-hold the little cry that sprang
to my lips as I read,—“An addition to the
coterie of pretty maids (for whom this city
is justly famous) who will adorn our society
this winter is Miss Elsie Travers, the guest of
Mr. and Mrs. George Somers, Iroquois
Avenue.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Mumsie, listen to this,” I cried, and
read it out. We all laughed; but how proud I
felt. I felt myself colouring to the roots of
my hair. After such a pretty notice, I hope I
shall find social progress easy.</p>

<p>“Elsie,” said Mumsie, beaming, “I congratulate
you. My Micawber here and I will
be completely outdistanced.”</p>

<p>“Elsie, I’m proud of you,” Uncle endorsed.</p>

<p>I hope he was sincere—he was certainly kind
enough.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang said nothing. I dislike him!</p>

<p>My eyes passed down the column and were
again arrested. “Mrs. Lien has issued invitations
to the younger set to a dance at her
home on New Year’s Eve.” No invitation had
come for me; my heart sank.</p>

<p>Again I read the notice aloud.</p>

<p>“No doubt a very swell affair,” suggested
Uncle, rather cynically.</p>

<p>“I must get you an invitation,” said Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Me! an invitation!” I exclaimed. “Can
you get me an invitation?”</p>

<p>“I can ask for one. In the old days———”</p>

<p>“Don’t do it, Auntie,” cut in Bang.</p>

<p>“Why not?” I demanded. Why should
this beast of a man interfere with me and my
joys and ambitions?</p>

<p>“Because,” and he looked at me with the
most exasperating smile I have ever seen on a
man’s face, “I can arrange it—I can ask Mrs.
Malone.”</p>

<p>I gasped and then I wilted. I hope I did
not display the anger I had felt.</p>

<p>“That would do nicely,” agreed Mumsie.
“Good idea.”</p>

<p>Whatever I had done or whatever misdirected
temper I displayed, I must see it
through, so I asked, with what I hoped was a
sincere smile:</p>

<p>“That would be so kind of you Mr. Bang,
but who is Mrs. Malone that she does as you
wish?”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Malone happens to be the society
editress of the <span class='it'>Telegraph</span>, and when she suggests
a social favour it is generally acted
upon.” He was certainly frank enough and
natural. “Besides, something you may well
be excused for not knowing, Mrs. Lien clapped
eyes on me the other day. If I mistake not
she knows I am your fellow guest, and if
Auntie asks an invitation for you, it will carry
with it a suggestion for me, which I don’t want
at any cost. Mrs. Malone will discreetly
acquaint Mrs. Lien with the fact that I leave
for Toronto on New Year’s Eve.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang was more good natured at the
close of his big speech, but did the world ever
know such another man?</p>

<p>No more was said, and Mr. Bang went with
Uncle to town; I to my room. About lunch-time
the telephone rang and Mumsie was told
by Mrs. Lien that an invitation for me was
on the way.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I walked out with Mumsie
and we ended up at the Queen Charlotte tea-rooms.
Whom should we meet there but Mrs.
Bassett and Ethel? Of course we joined them.
In two minutes Mrs. Bassett was pouring out
a tale of woe about her cook who was Scotch
and untidy. The standard topic of respectable
society seems to be the servant question.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about servants—old country
servants, at least the kind we get out here,
are exasperating, and the native-born domestic
has ceased to exist. I’m all right now, but
a month ago I had a terror—English. She
wore white, transparent stockings, and tennis
shoes about the house and, above deck, low
neck dresses. I told her she must alter her
attire, and she used up a bottle of my blacking
transforming her tennis shoes. As to
rising she was another Elsie Marley. One
morning Mr. Somers met her on the stairs
late as usual, and told her he was about to take
her breakfast up to her. This did not affect
her in the least for next day she admired a
brooch I was wearing. ‘What a nice brooch,’
she exclaimed, ‘are the stones real?’ ”</p>

<p>This sort of talk went on until in came Mrs.
Mount. I was so glad, for although Mrs. Bassett
was warming up, she was yet leagues
behind Mrs. Mount in her appeal to my interest.
Imagine my joy, therefore, when I saw
Mrs. Mount making directly towards us. She
bounced up to our table and sat down, giving
an order to a waitress as she did so. “So glad
to see you both,” she gushed, evidently viewing
Ethel and myself as nonentities or not
viewing us at all, “Doris and I are sailing on
the <span class='it'>Carmania</span> from New York for the Mediterranean
on January 15th; and, do you know,
really, it is such a fag. There’s Mrs. Lien’s
ball on New Year’s Eve. Of course Doris
must have a new dress and possibly I may give
a dance too, before we sail. I suppose you
girls have been invited?” And we were for
the first time honoured by her notice.</p>

<p>“They both are going,” replied Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Lien is so kind; and, after all, there
is nothing like the old families, provided there
is go in them.”</p>

<p>I could see however, she was surprised at
my being invited.</p>

<p>“What I was going to say is that I will take
this opportunity of saying good-bye.”</p>

<p>“You like Italy?” I could see Mumsie was
brimming with merriment.</p>

<p>“Yes, I like Italy,” she threw her head back
as if to bring her chin into special prominence.
“But, now it is so beastly common, full of
trippers, German and American. One meets
them everywhere and cannot get away from
them. Their ways are”—she paused for the
word—“uncouth. Naples?—No! Rome?—No!
Florence? Yes. Florence has the best
tea-room in Europe.”</p>

<p>“Venice must be very interesting,” suggested
Mrs. Bassett, with a half sigh that told
me she felt her prospects of seeing Italy were
remote, and her desire to do so great, “the
Palace of the Doges,—the Lion of St. Mark.”</p>

<p>“Venice is no place to go to; most disappointing.
There is not a decent tea-room in
the place.”</p>

<p>Mumsie seemed amused at this, and Ethel
Bassett grinned broadly. After this last delivery
the lady with a few more gushes shook
hands with us all and beamed upon Ethel and
me. Possibly this was by way of recompense
for her earlier slight.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount seems a woman of whims; no
doubt is of a nervous disposition. At the rink
only two days ago she was, I am sure, on the
verge of declaring herself my friend. To-day
she announces she is off to Europe and treats
me as if she had never seen me before.</p>

<p>I waited until soup was finished at dinner
to-night ere I thanked Mr. Bang for his good
offices. “Possibly you have more than that to
thank him for,” suggested Mumsie.</p>

<p>“I have thanked him for the skins,” I
replied.</p>

<p>“Possibly there is something else,” she
added.</p>

<p>I looked at my benefactor but his face was
inscrutable. He evidently had no desire to
have this line of conversation pursued, for he
put in:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Malone is one of the few women in
this city for whom I have a regard.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I said. I couldn’t help it. A man
has no right suddenly to make that sort of
statement.</p>

<p>“She has had a hard time of it,” cried
Uncle, “drunken husband—one of the old
families—and has been forced to fight her way
by writing trash for the society columns,——”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Malone is a good friend, and a good
woman, and you know you always read the
social columns,” asserted Mumsie interrupting
her husband.</p>

<p>“Of course, to laugh at———”</p>

<p>“You read it, nevertheless; and therefore
justify those columns in the newspaper.”</p>

<p>“A newspaper is supposed to tell the news—the
news!” he emphasized.</p>

<p>“Isn’t the social column news?”</p>

<p>“No. It’s a free advertising column for
social climbers.”</p>

<p>“Which you and everybody else reads,
either because of your gaping curiosity, or because
you are a cynical old stick.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!”</p>

<p>This time Mumsie had downed Uncle beautifully
and I was glad. Uncle did not seem to
mind, however, for he turned to me and continued:</p>

<p>“Remember, my dear, as your young mind
seems set upon these vain things, Mrs. Malone
is a woman who can make or break the social
future of any boy or girl in this city. That
is why she can command almost any invitation
she cares to ask for. Our lady society-writers
on the whole, and Mrs. Malone in particular,
are, anyhow, just.”</p>

<p>“They are, and kindly too,” agreed Mr.
Bang. “Of course, they display their personal
bias occasionally; they would not be
human, if they didn’t. I know one girl at
least who first gained a reputation as a belle
and then won a rich husband through Mrs.
Malone’s good offices.”</p>

<p>“Evidently Mrs. Malone is not as exacting
as you are,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“The girl’s mother happens to be an old
friend of Mrs. Malone’s,” retorted Mr. Bang
with unnecessary severity. “The newspapers
as a rule give their society reporters free
scope,” he went on, “they being awake enough
not to overlook the wives and daughters of
good advertisers. But occasionally notices
are inspired. I know this because of experiences
I gained when I attended a public ball
in Toronto. I did not know many of the ladies
present, as is to be supposed; but outside the
few I danced with, saw a rather pretty girl I
knew. I did not ask her to dance for the reason
I did not think her people amounted to
much. Next day’s paper contained a triumphant
account of this damsel’s appearance, etc.,
etc., and I felt sorry I had not asked her to
dance, and then I knew myself to be a snob.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“And you certainly were!” said Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Jack,” laughed Uncle, “you
have anyhow the strength to confess your old
weakness.”</p>

<p>“A day or two later I met the lady who puts
together the society news for that particular
paper. The ball came up for discussion, and
I introduced the subject of the belle. ‘Oh,
yes, quite pretty, is she not? I do not know
her myself; she is a friend of our general manager’s,
who asked me to notice her favourably,’
was my friend’s reply. This actually
consoled me,” he went on, “but I could not
absolve myself of snobbishness.”</p>

<p>“And a knowledge of the fault in yourself
enables you to remark it in others,” I said, not
caring much if I offended or not.</p>

<p>“That’s it exactly. Isn’t Little Partner getting
severe?” he said. “Snobbery is always
disgusting.”</p>

<p>This was not the answer I had anticipated.
I could only smile in answer; what else could
I do? Mumsie smiled too, while Mr. Bang
naively added, “Had I had an English Public
School education, I should have had it knocked
out of me in my boyhood. Snobbishness is an
inherent human failing. It is only the truly
Christlike spirit that is free from it.”</p>

<p>This kaleidoscopic character had given himself
another turn and presented a new picture.
I had never recognized in him religious inclinations,
and had gathered from his tirades
against people in high places, that his was a
democratic nature. Mumsie evidently had a
similar impression, for she asked:</p>

<p>“How comes it, Jack, that you have
developed such a high regard for the English,
and please, when did you take religion?”</p>

<p>“I have not ‘taken’ religion as the cynical
call it, but Christ seems to me the perfect man,
free from every vice and worldliness and
meanness—and looked at in the light of His
ideal what a paltry organization your society
is.”</p>

<p>“And the Englishman?”</p>

<p>“We Canadians, as boys in the process of
ancestor worship, look upon the Englishman
as a superior being. As youths we meet the
remittance-man and consider ourselves infinitely
his superior. As grown men we recognize
the salt of the earth to be the English.
And”—he paused—“it is the judgment of
grown manhood that counts.”</p>

<p>“How is Timkins?” asked Uncle with an
aggression that displayed a marked desire to
change the subject, “is he a millionaire yet?”</p>

<p>“He is getting on that way.”</p>

<p>“And, who is Mr. Timkins?” I asked, interested
in anyone with whom this extraordinary
Bang was acquainted.</p>

<p>“Timkins is of Jack’s school of philosophy—Jack,
tell your Little Partner about Timkins.”</p>

<p>“Ha! Timkins is a chap, who has been
through the mill out West. He reads the news
of the stock-market, knows the especial affiliations
of each newspaper, broker, and many of
the reporters. He works on the theory that all
newspaper talk in the stock-market is inspired,
and governs himself accordingly—and
makes money.” Mr. Bang looked at Mumsie
and then at me somewhat defiantly.</p>

<p>“You means he gambles in the market!”
suggested Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Auntie,” replied Mr. Bang with mock
gravity, (I assume it was affected, though it
seemed so real) “I’m afraid you stick to the
respectable at any and every cost. This is
the great Canadian tendency.” Turning to
me, he continued, (and I put down his words
as I am able, for I am not used to the phrases
of the market, but I think I have it). “According
to Mr. Timkins, the tendency people
have to cater to the respectable is played upon
by those who sell stocks. A purchaser comes
to a broker with money he wishes to employ.
Nine times out of ten he is a buyer and probably
names an issue or two that have suggested
themselves to him. Nine times out of
ten, the broker has special affiliations, so he
hedges the customer about with one objection
after another, until he has him on the path he
wishes. In this process, if all else fails, the
broker intimates that the course the customer
would pursue would be gambling, shrugs his
shoulders and leaves the old reliable spirit of
respectability to do the rest.”</p>

<p>“And—the rest?” asked Uncle.</p>

<p>“Is that the customer buys what the broker
wishes him to buy—and loses.”</p>

<p>“Always?” asked Mumsie. “You are much
too positive, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Well, Auntie, I think I’m justified. People
who follow the advice of those so-called
brokers lose nineteen times out of twenty;
statistics show it.”</p>

<p>“Why ‘so-called’ brokers?”</p>

<p>“Because the term broker means one who
buys and sells on commission, but many of our
brokers are really what in England is called
a jobber, who speculate for themselves and
underwriters.</p>

<p>“And your friend Mr. Timkins?”</p>

<p>“Plays a lone hand and wins. He is the
twentieth or the hundredth, as the case may
be.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think that is a very respectable way
to make money,” objected Mumsie.</p>

<p>“If you take the ordinary broker’s advice,
there is no fear of your making money—according
to Timkins.”</p>

<p>“Bother Timkins!”</p>

<p>“People make money selling stocks, not
buying them.”</p>

<p>“You mean short selling?” asked Uncle
becoming interested.</p>

<p>“Either short selling or promoting, and
there is really not much difference.”</p>

<p>“I never could get at the bottom of this
short selling, do tell me what it means?”</p>

<p>“I have told you often,” Uncle said to his
wife. “No woman has ever been able to
understand it and not overly many men. In
ordinary commerce a man buys and sells later:
the short seller in the market, or the bear, sells
first and buys afterwards: it is the simple
reversal of a simple process.”</p>

<p>“But it’s gambling, I’ve read so in the
papers,” protested Mumsie.</p>

<p>“So are lots of things; in fact, it is a rare
process in this world that is not a gamble,”
replied Mr. Bang with heat. “I know the
whole argument, but let me say that anyone
who buys a stock because he thinks it will go
up is as much of a gambler as he who sells it
because he thinks it will go down. In England,
where the fundamentals are sought for,
and the people are not so much humbugged
as they are here, the prejudice against ‘selling
a bear’ in the market is unknown.”</p>

<p>“You’re joking.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I am not: our land is filled with
milk-fed sophistries and the men who propagate
them. The ordinary mind is incapable
of matching the processes of the wit of our
stock exchanges. Let us examine the processes
of one of our millionaires. He buys a water-power
for a trifle: organizes it into a stock
company, and sells stock to the widow and
orphan at an advance of anywhere from a hundred
to a thousand per cent. profit. He makes
his money not because he holds the stock, but
because he sells it—because the public buys
it.”</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable,” grimly asserted
Uncle.</p>

<p>“But the interesting study is that of the
public. The promoter makes a grant of say,
$50,000 to a charity. The foolish woman in
the country, doctor, or lawyer, reasons that
one who would give so much to the public must
be really very godly and would not cheat a
poor body, so he or she puts money into any
old proposition such philanthropists advance.
This, I fancy, is token of the shallowness of
the ordinary mind in financial matters, and
such shallowness explains why some men
easily accumulate wealth, the result of
labour.”</p>

<p>I believe Mr. Bang can see no good in anybody
or anything, his is—in spite of his personal
kindness, like the gift of the furs—a narrow
nature. Mumsie, I am sure, was not
convinced, no more was I; probably she
remained silent out of weariness.</p>

<p>“Jack, you certainly would not increase
your popularity by publishing such statements,”
said Uncle.</p>

<p>“I know that well. Timkins tried it with
the result that throughout the financial districts
every man’s voice was against him.
When you cannot refute a man’s statement,
the next thing to do is drown it with calumny.
The inference the public draws is that a liar
cannot speak the truth, or a dishonest man
honest, or a fool occasionally wise. So the
thing to do is to persuade the public that one’s
enemy is a liar, a rascal or a fool.”</p>

<p>“But, what has become of Timkins?”</p>

<p>“He fell into bad ways; he misjudged the
limitations of <span class='it'>The Tarbrush</span>, the sheet to
which he contributed, and wrote up the President
of a rascally mining promotion. The
President of the Mining Company was also
President of a social club to which the editor
and proprietor were ambitious members. In
the process of re-establishing themselves the
two jelly-fish wrote a letter of apology to the
injured president, promising to receive no
more communications from the offender. That
illustrates the processes of a certain type of
financial newspaper, for, after all, the writer
was not responsible, as the article had passed
a sub-editor.”</p>

<p>“And Timkins?”</p>

<p>“Timkins will go to London. As a budding
author he can establish himself there. All
Canadian writers, as soon as they begin to
gain a footing in the literary world here, go to
England. Canada is a land whose people do
not seem to trust their own.”</p>

<p>I am weary—it has been the most difficult
job I ever knew—of writing all these expressions
of Mr. Bang’s, but doing so is anyhow
practice for the book I am some day to write.
How agreeable a character he would be, did he
say pleasant things, instead of unpleasant;
were he constructive, instead of a puller-down.
But as I have decided before, he would never
do in a novel—never. And now about novels.
Mr. Bang appears to have opinions on all subjects.
I thought, therefore, I would ask him
what he knows about novel writing.</p>

<p>But before I could frame the question,
Mumsie began to tell of her gossip in the tea-room
and of having related the story of the
drowsy domestic.</p>

<p>“How old was she?” asked Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“About twenty-five,” Mumsie replied
patiently, though apparently not a little surprised
at the enquiry.</p>

<p>“It might not have been the girl’s fault at
all: extreme drowsiness is often developed in
a change of climate, especially in the case of
young people, and possibly the girl was not
accustomed to hard work———”</p>

<p>“She never did enough around here to keep
herself warm,” retorted Uncle. “You can
find much more worthy objects for your
sympathy, my boy.”</p>

<p>Advancing obscure and outlandish theories
is evidently a habit with Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Mumsie reported Mrs. Mount’s conversation.
Uncle and Mr. Bang roared when they
heard what she said about the tea-rooms. I’m
afraid there is some point in that I don’t quite
see: I shall not ask, because to do so would
display ignorance, but what could be more
natural than that a lady travelling should
visit especially those cities with the nice tea-rooms?</p>

<p>“What is your idea of the Mediterranean
trip?” Uncle asked, looking towards Mr.
Bang. I verily believe Uncle asked the question
to draw him out, for my especial benefit.
How Uncle could dream of my being entertained
by such expressions of ill-nature I
don’t know. I hope he is not slyly poking fun
at me.</p>

<p>“The Mediterranean trip is a most beneficial
experience for a Canadian: it teaches him to
value his own country. ‘Thank God I live in
Canada,’ is the exclamation of most of us, as
we view the filth of Naples, hear its noise, and
suffer from its chilling winds, when the weather
is mean.”</p>

<p>“See Naples and die,” quoted Uncle.</p>

<p>“Among my grandfather’s papers,” said
Mr. Bang, “is a letter from one of his staff
when on a visit to Naples in 1823. The writer
says he would value the place more, if there
was less noise and more honesty.”</p>

<p>“There is Pompeii,” suggested Mumsie.
“That’s some compensation.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mr. Bang reflectively, “there
is Pompeii. Pompeii will always remind me
of Captain Jinks, an English gentleman-guide,
who according to his own account, had
already gone through two fortunes, and, unsatisfied
with past exploits, wanted to go
through mine.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang paused for us to laugh, though
my mirth must have sounded hollow, for I
merely followed Uncle’s example. I could
not see anything clever in the remark.</p>

<p>“The vast majority of people,” Mr. Bang
continued, “who go to Italy in the winter are
of the Mrs. Mount type, mere slaves of silly
fashion. Jinks told me of a Yankee, who gave
him a commission at five hundred dollars, to
write a genealogy, tracing his descent from a
citizen of Pompeii, who, as a butcher, flourished
previous to A.D. 78. The only fact upon
which the descent was to be based was a fancied
similarity of names.”</p>

<p>Now was my chance; I cut in.</p>

<p>“It is a puzzle to me, Mr. Bang, that with
all your varied experiences, you have never
attempted to write a book.”</p>

<p>“He has literary ideas too,” seconded
Mumsie, evidently approving of my attempt
at conversation.</p>

<p>“Perhaps, some day,” gravely responded
the adventurer, “in the meantime I am supplying
Timkins with mighty thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Drat Timkins, but if it must be Timkins,
what has he to say on book building?”</p>

<p>“Have a story and tell it, use simple language
and be consistent, and above all make
your characters stand out. That’s his gospel.
No matter how you do it, make each character
announce himself in the first sentence he
utters; and maintain it no matter if your
character is like nothing on the earth above,
and talks a dialect that never was uttered by
tongue of man, make him say, ‘It is I, Jacques,
who says it.’ ”</p>

<p>“Jack has, as always, the right idea,” said
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Oh you men!” said Auntie.</p>

<p>“In painting and sculpture it is the same.
The great masters, both with the brush and
the chisel, formed lines out of proportion and
introduced figures in impossible positions, but
they told their story, they reached their aim.
So with letters.”</p>

<p>“And then out West we have the animal
fakers. Lord! how the men of the wilds do
hate those fellows who hear the dear beasts
talk like Sunday teachers.”</p>

<p>“They make lots of money,” suggested
Uncle, ever practical.</p>

<p>“So they do, and so do the chaps who manufacture
quack medicines.”</p>

<p>I won’t write any more of this dialogue;
I’m tired and it is all really much the same.
I really wonder more and more as the days go
by, why I bother over Mr. Bang. I suppose I
give him more space than Uncle for two reasons;
one, because he says more; secondly,
because his aggressive manner impresses
itself upon me. I dislike the man exceedingly.</p>

<p>But what he said about writing, I have
taken to heart. Let me analyze my diary to
date. Of characters I have Mumsie first.
Then Uncle and Mr. Bang—one the same
character as the other, only more so. I’ll
leave Uncle out of it as a character, and hold
out Mr. Bang. Then there’s Mrs. Mount. She
is a character certainly. And then I believe
I am a character too.</p>

<p>One, two, three, four real, live characters,
that would do for a story. If Mr. Bang would
only elope, or commit a murder, or flare-up
in some way, I might make this into something.
As it is there is too much philosophy
and talk in this diary and too little action.
However, Mrs. Lien’s party is coming, and
with the passing of New Year’s Day society
will get under way again. I wonder what
Mumsie was hinting at in suggesting that I
had something more for which my thanks were
due to Mr. Bang. Could it be—did he inspire
that notice in the newspaper—ask Mrs.
Malone to insert it. Had he wished to please
me he could not have done better, but then
why is he inconsistent? He condemns social
ambition and conceit in others. Why should
he encourage it in me?</p>

<p>The furs are to be home to-morrow evening.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 28th.</span></span></p>

<p>“I wish you all to come and see a hockey
match with me to-night,” said Mr. Bang, at
breakfast.</p>

<p>“The Maple Leafs against the Beavers?”
enquired Uncle.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should care to go,” said
Mumsie. “I must do a lot of running round
this afternoon———”</p>

<p>“And I have some reading which I must
do and which I have put off already too long,
but you and Elsie go.” This from Uncle. It
struck me that he was fibbing and that Mumsie
would not have been too tired had she
really wished to go, or had not a reason for
staying away.</p>

<p>“I don’t think I should like to go. Hockey
does not interest me,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Have you ever seen a real hockey match?”
Mr. Bang asked.</p>

<p>“I have seen the school boys playing it on
the ice at home.”</p>

<p>“That’s not real hockey,” said Uncle looking
at me over his glasses, with his dear,
kindly twinkle. “You had better accept
Jack’s invitation; it will be a grand sight.
There’ll be thousands there and the game
should be one of the best of the season.”</p>

<p>“The first of the Champion series,” said
Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Do go, Elsie, I’m sure you’ll enjoy it,”
persuaded Mumsie.</p>

<p>“There’ll be thousands there?” I asked
weakly.</p>

<p>“There will be three or four thousand,”
replied Uncle.</p>

<p>“Anything up to ten thousand,” Mr. Bang
added.</p>

<p>I agreed to go.</p>

<p>Much shouting seemed to make the great
rink shake, as we entered; shout after shout
went up. The giant building seemed to vibrate
with noise.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang grasped my arm and struggled
through the swaying mass of people crowding
the entrances; and when I got inside I found
myself beneath a great vaulted roof ribbed by
arches bearing a myriad of electric lights.</p>

<p>Around the ice a great amphitheatre was
ranged, rising till it met the roof; and the
whole was drawn on such magnitude and the
occupants of the seats were so densely numerous,
that in nearly every direction I found it
impossible to pick out individuals. I knew
those black and mottled masses ranged about
me were human beings, closely packed,
because they could be nothing else, and the
noise was human, but otherwise they were
merely a vague, vast mass.</p>

<p>We found our seats, they were behind two
young men, who kept up an almost continuous
shouting, with frequent gesticulation. I suppose
throwing the arms about might be properly
called gesticulating.</p>

<p>When not giving vent to their exuberance,
they exchanged remarks in voices that were
hoarse, from liquor or shouting, possibly from
both.</p>

<p>Only vaguely, at first, could I make out the
contest. Figures were rushing about at marvellous
speed, doubling back, twisting, circling.
Sticks were banging, skates were clashing,
and men were tumbling.</p>

<p>As my eyes became accustomed to the light
I made out the costumes of the players: some
were in pale blue with white stripes, the others
in red with black stripes. Mr. Bang volunteered
the information that the players in blue
were the Beavers, and those in red the Maple
Leafs. My eyes began to mark the movements
and exploits of two of the players, one was
a great fat Maple Leaf, evidently known as
Buster; the other a slight, wiry, nimble, scurrying,
dashing, eminently agile, fair-haired
youth, belonging to the Beavers. “Go it, Lien,
well done, Beavers, lean to it,” shouted the
enthusiasts.</p>

<p>The name struck me, I whispered an
enquiry.</p>

<p>“He is Mrs. Lien’s son,” said my companion.</p>

<p>Instinctively I named the fat man Froggy.
Buster might do for the populace, but to me
he appeared a great, fat frog. No doubt Buster
was a name applied when his present
proportions were less. His movements were
those of a frog; in skating he held his legs far
apart and drew them after him, skate edge to
ice. He was “Back” on his side, a sort of
outpost to the goal-keeper. His movements
were deliberate and seldom hurried, at least
they were performed in a matter of fact sort
of way, yet they were wonderfully effective.</p>

<p>Clashes between Lien and Froggy were frequent.
In fact the game seemed to be carried
on through the strivings of these two. The
movements of the forwards were too quick
almost for the eye to follow, but out of the
confusion Lien would dart, manoeuvring the
puck. Now he would slam it against the side
boards and dodging his opponents, pick it up
and on towards the goal and the obtruding
Froggy. Again he would carry it down the
middle of the rink, feinting, feigning, dodging:
he was simply marvellous. Soon I too
was breathless with excitement and felt glad
the two young men made so much noise, for my
enthusiasm matched theirs. Even the infection
carried to my companion, as shown by his
fixed attention and occasional shout of
approval or groan of dismay.</p>

<p>Once the Leafs carried the puck close upon
the goal of the Beavers and the raid ended in
a grand mêlée. Out of this darted Lien with
the puck, with two swift raiders after him.
The whole sheet of ice was clear save for
Froggy and the goal-keeper. Blows fell upon
Lien’s stick and bodies bumped against him,
but he managed to worm his way through.
Then he was forced against the right side of
the rink, and it looked as if he would be either
checked or compelled to resort to the dangerous
expedient of bumping the puck into the
boards. His opponents closed in, and he
manoeuvred his club to dash the puck against
the boards.</p>

<p>But it was a feint. So quick that eye could
scarce follow the move, he twitched the puck
into the middle of the ice, jumped over an
opponent’s club, and picking up the puck
again, was off. The cheer that went up
seemed as if it would lift the roof, friend and
foe seemed to combine in frenzy. In a second
he was upon Froggy, my heart stood still. For
the first time he eluded him and shot the puck
at goal. The cheering was frantic, evidently
anticipating a victory. But not yet. The
puck was met by one of the goal-keepers and
although young Lien threw himself against
the goal-keeper, as if to carry puck and man
together in the onslaught, the desperate
recourse was of no avail. With his skate the
goal-keeper knocked away the puck and a
friendly stick sent it spinning behind the goal.
Everybody, including myself, cheered.</p>

<p>“A fast game,” murmured my companion.
“How do you like it?”</p>

<p>“It’s grand, Oh! I adore it—the excitement,”
and I smiled. It was the first time I
had felt cordial towards him.</p>

<p>Almost at once after the unsuccessful try
the puck was at the Beavers’ goal, threatening
it—occasion for more shouting. What a fast
game hockey is! How exhilarating to watch!
How I envied those boys. What excitement,
what exhilaration it must be for them! Here
was fame spontaneous, overwhelming, real.
This was their world, much what the social
world would be to me,—I hoped.</p>

<p>Time was called and the cheering fell to a
subdued murmur. The players left the ice for
their dressing-rooms. The first period was
over—no score.</p>

<p>The interval, of course, was devoted to conversation,
but I used the opportunity to look
about me.</p>

<p>I could see people, no doubt in society,
women well and fashionably dressed, men
prosperous-looking and intelligent. But my
opportunities of observation were extremely
limited, extending only to right and left of me
a small distance, in front of me and behind.
Of course, it would not be good form to stare
over my shoulder too often. The opposite side
of the amphitheatre and the ends were too far
distant for exact observation.</p>

<p>“Say, I tell you, this is some game,” I heard
one flashy young man say to the other.</p>

<p>“That ain’t no lie,” replied his companion.</p>

<p>“First period gone, and no score!”</p>

<p>“That’s going some.”</p>

<p>“Lien is right up to the mark; say that fellow
could get five thousand dollars a season if
he turned professional.”</p>

<p>“That ain’t no lie neither, but say, what’s
the use of money to a guy like that, his father’s
got lots.”</p>

<p>“They say his father’s father stole it from
the ‘boobs’.”</p>

<p>“I guess that ain’t no dream. Most fellows
what get money steals it anyway one way or
another.”</p>

<p>“Cornering hockey tickets is stealing money
I say, or makin’ a feller stand in line all night
to pay two dollars and a half each for them
ain’t no better. Tickets were bringin’ ten
dollars apiece at five o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<p>Imagine paying ten dollars, or even two dollars
and a half, to see a hockey match, and my
companion must have paid well for his, for
he did not purchase until to-day. I had
thought the cost of admission must have been
twenty-five cents at the most; and the thousands
present! I am afraid Mr. Bang is
extravagant.</p>

<p>The intermission ended and again the sides
“faced off.” A clash of sticks, a scraping of
skates and the game was on. The crowd gave
a shout, evidently for practice, possibly it was
exultation that again something was doing,
for in hockey something is doing every
minute.</p>

<p>In the second period Lien made one of the
earliest drives; he picked the puck out of the
initial scrimmage and got away with it. Of
course much noise was made. I believe our
people like to work themselves into a frenzy,
noise being both the cause and the expression
of that condition.</p>

<p>The second period was even more swift and
exciting than the first; and what an excitement
there was when Lien finally scored a
goal! A moment before he had fallen, tripped
over another player’s skate and sprawled at
full length over the ice and lay as if stunned.
No doubt he was. But waking he caught sight
of the puck coming towards him. He jumped
to his feet, made a dash on goal, outwitted
Froggy and landed the puck. What a cheer
there was! What yelling, shouting, cat-calls,
and the hammering of hockey sticks against
the boards that bounded the ice! How proud
I felt, for I had glued my sympathy to Lien,
not that I cared for his mother, but it was that
I knew something of him and I disliked
Froggy, and also (perhaps this was the most
potent influence) I felt my companion’s interest
was with the Leafs and against Lien.</p>

<p>As I watched the continuance of the battle,
the raging, storming men, charging and clashing
through entangled sticks and ringing
skates, I found my mind occupied with the
problem of whether Mr. Bang’s championing
of the Leafs was due to predilections for them,
or to mere opposition.</p>

<p>The finish came, the Beavers away in the
lead and Lien the darling of the populace.
With the close of the contest a stream of
figures jumped over the boards to the ice and
crowded round the players, and in me was
awakened a spirit of pride, as I noticed the
marked demonstrations directed towards Lien.</p>

<p>Slowly the masses moved towards the exits.
The shoutings had died away and in its place
was the shuffling of feet and the clatter of conversation.
With my cavalier I passed towards
the street.</p>

<p>A woman hailed Mr. Bang; he turned to
her. She had a clever face, with kind eyes
and was dressed in workable, rather than
fashionable clothes.</p>

<p>“So this is your Little Partner; well, she’s
all you said of her.” She beamed at me.</p>

<p>“Yes, this is she,” and turning to me, Mr.
Bang said, “Let me introduce you to Mrs.
Malone.”</p>

<p>I greeted Mrs. Malone with warmth; had
she not spoken well of me, and did not Uncle
say she could make or break any boy or girl
in the social world.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t he lovely?” I asked with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“You mean Charlie Lien? Yes, he’s a wonderful
boy if he does not get his head turned.
I suppose this was quite a novelty to you?”
Mrs. Malone accompanied the question with a
smile, so good natured that her question did
not appear the least patronizing.</p>

<p>“Believe me, she is quite a fan,” put in Mr.
Bang, whereat I laughed.</p>

<p>We entered the street and as we did so great
gusts of snow-laden wind came down. A blizzard
had got up during the process of the
game and drove against us in breath-taking,
blinding swirls.</p>

<p>“How are you going to get home?” asked
my cavalier of his jolly friend.</p>

<p>“Walk,” she answered.</p>

<p>“Walking through the storm is fine fun for
the young and active———”</p>

<p>“But grass widows of uncertain age had
better take a cab, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should think so.” How horribly frank
Mr. Bang is; but then Mrs. Malone seemed to
take it as a joke. “Wait here and see if I can
engage one,” and away he went leaving me
with her. We tried to put our backs against
the storm but this ended in our tramping
round and round, for the immense building
seemed so to twist the wind that it came from
every direction at once.</p>

<p>“Glorious, isn’t it?” laughed Mrs. Malone.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I gasped.</p>

<p>“There is not a cab to be had,” announced
the spectral figure of Mr. Bang, as he loomed
up out of the storm. “We’ll see you home;
you’re good for it, are you not, Little Partner?”</p>

<p>So we, notwithstanding her protests, walked
home with Mrs. Malone and sought temporary
refuge in her flat, whence Mr. Bang telephoned
for a sleigh and in due course he and I arrived
home. Mrs. Malone kissed me as I left her,
so no doubt I have a place in her regard, even
after all allowance is made for the warmth of
her Irish heart.</p>

<p>I lay long awake glowing with warmth, the
reaction after our struggle through the storm,
and with satisfaction at being snug in bed;
while outside the storm raged.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 29th.</span></span></p>

<p>This morning at breakfast I noticed Mumsie
look puzzled as she read a letter she had
just received. Then my eye caught that of
Uncle’s and he, too, read his wife’s face.</p>

<p>“What have you got?” asked he.</p>

<p>Mumsie sighed.</p>

<p>“Anything serious, your death warrant?”</p>

<p>“Just a letter from Mary.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” exclaimed Mr. Bang. “What
does she want now?”</p>

<p>“She does not say she wishes for anything,”
replied Mumsie.</p>

<p>“She never does,” retorted Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Let us have it,” suggested Uncle.</p>

<p>“My dear Aunt Bell: It was so sweet of
you to remember me at Christmas: (I sent her
a card only) it is so satisfactory to know one
is not forgotten. (I send her a card every
Christmas, but this is the only time she has
ever acknowledged one.) The children had a
splendid time, especially Jessie. Lawrence is
yet too young to anticipate his joys or measure
their fulness. Everybody was so good to
them. Jessie was enraptured with the doll
Jack sent her, and Lawrence makes no end of
a row with his horn. James put up with it
over Christmas day, but since then, insists we
hide it when he is at home.</p>

<p>“How is dear Jack? I should like so much
to see the dear boy. It is so nice too, that
Uncle takes such an interest in him. I wonder
when I shall see him again.</p>

<p>“With love to all, I remain,</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:10em;'>“Affectionately yours,</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:right;margin-right:5em;'>“Mary.”</p>

<p>“That is plain as day,” commented Mr.
Bang. “She wishes to pay you a visit or come
to town for some reason or other, possibly to
do some shopping.”</p>

<p>“Who is Mary,” I enquired, full of wonder
at such open criticism, even from Mr. Bang.
I cannot help asking questions.</p>

<p>“My sister,” coldly replied Mr. Bang, “has
a husband, a civil servant, named James
Strickland. Sister Mary is respectable, and
the personification of propriety.”</p>

<p>There seemed to me bitterness in Mr. Bang’s
tone.</p>

<p>“I fancy Jack is right. Mary wishes to pay
us a visit,” declared Uncle in a matter of fact
tone.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” asked Mumsie absentmindedly.</p>

<p>“Ask her to come,” replied he with decision.</p>

<p>“Where can I put her?” Mumsie then
asked, wrinkling her forehead.</p>

<p>“Give her my room, put me anywhere, or I
can go to an hotel,” said Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“You’ll stay right here,” said Uncle.
“She’ll only want one room, even if she brings
the children. Hope she does, I’d like to see
’em.”</p>

<p>“I’ll give up my room if you have any other
place to put me,” I said, with a forced cheerfulness,
for the idea of giving up my room was
really unpleasant.</p>

<p>“I’ll write and ask her and the children,
perhaps she does not really wish to come.”</p>

<p>“Auntie, I wager you a box of candy she
comes,” declared Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>To-morrow evening is Skating Club night.
Mr. Bang’s friend Mr. Timkins has put him
up there, and for some time at least I shall
have entree. So it would be well for me to
practise waltzing. But Badger Lake would be
covered with the snow of last night’s storm.
Somehow or other I blurted out my desires
and fears at breakfast.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang knew of a rink we could go to.
No, it was not the hockey rink, nor the Skating
Club rink, but another. I wonder why Mr.
Bang is so attentive to Me. I surely am not
overly polite to him. Why is he so patient—so
unnaturally so, it almost seems? I wonder
if he will marry. Our personalities—his and
mine—are far from being parallel, so that I
am safe. What keeps him east? He says
business, and, indeed, he leaves for Toronto on
New Year’s Eve. If he wants a wife, I should
suggest his addressing his attention to Ethel
Bassett. She is the type of womanhood of
which he approves. I cannot admire dowdiness
myself.</p>

<p>Again, Mr. Bang’s bitterness puzzles me.
Fancy anyone disliking a sister enough to
speak of her as he spoke. I determined upon
asking him why it should be so, and as we
walked to the rink I did so.</p>

<p>“Do I?” he cried. “I’m sorry if I appear
bitter, bitter is an ugly word but no doubt I
have earned it, if you, who are my friend, find
bitterness in my words. Sister Mary is a type—one
of those scheming women, scheming in
harmless little ways, who fancies herself
clever, when she is really most transparent. I
think you may accept it as an axiom, that the
average of us are more adept at seeing through
the schemes of others than covering up one’s
own designs. Sister Mary had a great deal to
do with bringing me up; perhaps my bitterness
arises from her having made so complete
a failure of the job.”</p>

<p>“Are you a failure?” I asked with genuine
surprise. A man who can give away furs!</p>

<p>But my interruption did not alter the trend
of his ideas.</p>

<p>“I fancy though, I may justly charge her
with the hatred I have for the respectable. The
inherent pugnacity of the human animal made
me irresponsible early in life, partly as an
affectation, but later from habit and inclination.</p>

<p>“How strange!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Not strange, but a frequent circumstance:
the parson’s son is proverbially a madcap.”</p>

<p>We skated about, hand in hand: my
thoughts dwelling upon the strange being who
was my companion. My mental attitude
towards him had undergone a change. My
interest, my sympathy were aroused. He was
in the full glow of manhood, full of ambition,
fighting his way in the world; and evidently
doing so successfully. His abilities were constructive;
his past had been hard. The story
he told at the Christmas dinner while showing
what he had seen and experienced also showed
much of himself. Yet he could be egotistical.
He is one of those who can talk of themselves
without paining or boring the hearer; after
all, a rare and delightful accomplishment. But
his peculiar animosity to his sister I could not
understand. I prompted him.</p>

<p>“I often think,” he said, his voice soft, his
speech slow and thoughtful, his utterance suggesting
his desire to speak true, “that I perhaps
wrong my sister; that the lack of balance,
which I had so much trouble in combating in
my earlier youth was due really to heredity. I
believe that many of the tendencies which
experience has told me are to my hurt were as
strongly developed in and as detrimental to my
grandfather. It is wrong, I believe, to look
upon a child’s character as something which
may be moulded as a piece of clay. One
might as well try and mould his features.”</p>

<p>“But that may be done,” I exclaimed,
remembering the maternal squeezing of some
infant snub-noses.</p>

<p>“But an Apollo could not be made out of
Richard the Third. No,” he went on thoughtfully,
as is his wont, “we are in appearance as
nature intended us to be, and temperamentally
also. We may use artifice to change our
appearance or we may study mannerisms—some
do—but they are all more or less subterfuge.
As a child my failing was unwittingly
to antagonize people, and the same attribute
was the bane of my grandfather.”</p>

<p>“Tell me of him,” I suggested, and I think
my curiosity pleased him.</p>

<p>“He was educated in law; and, when the
California gold excitement developed, walked
across the continent to San Francisco. There
he wished to practise his profession, but the
Yankees would not let him do so, unless he
became naturalized. This he refused to do—a
right Canadian he!—so he worked in the
mines and then walked home again and died
in penury. The probabilities are that he
would have accumulated great wealth had he
become a citizen of California, the opportunity
there was so great.”</p>

<p>“He was at least a patriot,” I suggested.
“Bravo for Canada!”</p>

<p>“Assuredly he was so. His son, my Uncle,
told my mother that his lack of success in life
was due neither to lack of ability, nor of
industry, but to his unfortunate manner,
which alienated the sympathy of those he
met.”</p>

<p>“Dear! Dear! I have heard of such people,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied my companion, “such failings
are sometimes, even, the attributes of
genius, but in the case of my grandfather and
Uncle I have never heard that either developed
brilliancy in any direction.”</p>

<p>“And yourself?” I asked. “Perhaps you
———”</p>

<p>He laughed. “If I have any genius, it has
yet to be proved, and I’m old enough to have
doubts of it. I’ve inherited the wrong traits
that’s certain. Perhaps it is that those of us
who believe in heredity find its evidence in
our faults.”</p>

<p>For the first time Mr. Bang spoke to me
without shrouded facetiousness but in earnest,
and I felt pleased. I forgot he was a young
man; and I am ready to believe he forgot I
was a girl. We were just friends. It was a
new experience to me and I welcomed it.</p>

<p>Suddenly I came to realize there were others
about, that I was skating round and round the
rink with my companion openly holding my
hand. I brought myself up with a round turn,
and suggested we practise our figures, threes
and eights.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang came out of his reverie. He corrected
my skating in a kindly way, though he
was exact enough, and showed no tendency to
gloss over my mistakes. After an hour’s skating,
we decided to walk home. I was glad of
this, for it gave opportunity for further conversation
and I asked him several questions,
to which generally he said—as well as I can
remember it:</p>

<p>“I don’t think I was a bad boy; I never had
any vices except indolence; yet I alienated my
people at such an early date that I cannot
remember the time when they did not think it
necessary to apologize to others for me.
Pleasant, wasn’t it? Ours was a large family,
yet no member of it dreamed of planting in
my mind those seeds of worldly wisdom so
useful to youth. On the other hand, I was
shunted, given up for hopeless, before I was
well on the threshold of life. My mother,
while she taught me the Bible, sighed: ‘What
will become of the boy?’ That sort of apology
did not improve me. One brother was in the
habit of telling me I would be a perpetual
expense to the family, though he did not help
me to learn to do otherwise, or give me any
money encouragement. I was certainly kept
in the back ground. The result was that I
early got so mean an opinion of myself that I
was ready to apologize for my very existence.
Whether this was an inherited trait and itself
explains the attitude of my people towards
me, or whether it developed under the contempt
of my own people, I have no opinion. I
had to be a sort of crab. Couldn’t help it!”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang could not have offered me a
greater token of friendship than so to lay bare
before me his thoughts and confidence like
this. Why he should do so is the greater
puzzle the more I think of it. Had I been as
frank with him what a mean girl I should
seem.</p>

<p>“I suppose,” he continued with a smile,
“you will see me as the small boy, who ever
laments that he is not understood—like so
many martyrs in novels and dramas?”</p>

<p>I could only answer with a smile, also. Then
we trudged along not speaking. The night was
falling, the air was clear and refreshing: but
the jingle of the bells on the passing sleighs,
and hootings of the motor horns spoiled the
peace. The bells brought to me visions of the
old Canadian world, of a homely social life,
such as Uncle talks of and looks back upon
with sighs. The hootings seemed the message
of a new order, the power of wealth—discordant
and a pollution. And then I started
inwardly; was I a traitor to my own ambitions?
I had recently become a convert to the
new order; why was I forsaking my allegiance?</p>

<p>As we were nearly home Mr. Bang added:
“Being what I was, I followed the lines of least
resistance and went west. Settled industry
and competition with normal personalities
offered me no field; and by a natural process
I evaded the issue. I threw myself into the
mill. I fought while I starved, and starved
while I fought. It was a stern conflict, a
bitter struggle.”</p>

<p>My companion paused ere he continued:</p>

<p>“There is no personality so out of tune with
mankind but he will be attractive to some one;
no nature so unlovely but will find a responding
chord; no murderer but may gain an advocate;
so there is no money-making scheme so
unbalanced but will draw support from some
foolish purse.”</p>

<p>“There never was a Jack, without a Jill,”
I said. I don’t know why I said it; it just
came out.</p>

<p>“There never was a Jack who could not find
his Jill—though sometimes, alas! too late.”</p>

<p>“I once found a friend,” he ventured. “We
won.”</p>

<p>We found Mumsie in the hall; I kissed her
and ran to my room; I was unsettled. In my
ears sounded the sleigh bells. My conscience
was troubling me; perhaps it was my self-respect,
the spirit of my forefathers. Like a
ghost of the past my grandfather’s presence
was with me, reproving me, admonishing me,
cherishing me.</p>

<p>I dressed for dinner and gained mastery of
myself. I was happy, laughed to myself, was
singing softly a bit of a song, and perfumed
my hair and neck. I was grasping for a new
foothold, struggling to find myself. My spirits
were so unsettled, so boisterous. Mr. Bang
looked puzzled and watched me intently.
Evidently he had expected other things. He,
poor fool, claims to read women like a book;
and yet, while I am false to his friendship, in
its every phase, he this afternoon bared his
heart to me, as one could only do to a trusted
and valued friend.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 30th.</span></span></p>

<p>My furs arrived to-day. They are lovely.
It was so good of Uncle to have them made up
for me and I feel I am able to carry them off
well. Went shopping in the morning, walked
with Mumsie in the afternoon, and to the Skating
Club with Mr. Bang in the evening. As a
precaution I asked Ethel Bassett to call for
me, so she shared the burden of Mr. Bang. I
kept in a corner practising.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>December 31st.</span></span></p>

<p>How can I compose myself sufficiently to
record all that befell me, all I experienced, and
the world I was introduced to at Mrs. Lien’s
ball? My hand trembles as I take up my pen.
As I was yesterday a different person from
what I was when first I entered Uncle’s home,
so to-day I am different from what I was a
few short hours ago. I know now that another
world exists of which previously I had
not even dreamed. I have found myself overflowing
with emotion, pulsating, trembling
under the spell of curious impulses. Oh! what
a strange being am I!</p>

<p>Ethel Bassett called for me in a cab and
came into the hall to say Good-evening to
Mumsie and Uncle.</p>

<p>At least that was the ostensible reason;
perhaps it was pride in her appearance that
was the real influence. If so, it was justified.
For I gazed at her a moment, standing beneath
a flood of crimson light from the shaded hall
lamp, and, strangely enough, realized I looked
upon a higher type than myself. She is what
Mr. Bang or Uncle would call a “sound girl,”
and with the white collar of her opera cloak
about her ears, her charms were well set off.
She has a shy manner, and her cheeks are
dimpled and cherry-red, almost as clear as my
own. A man could see in her more than half
the charms usually found in a novelist’s
heroine and what more could any man want?
What more could Mr. Bang want? I feel Mr.
Bang is looking for a wife. Why does he not
pay suit to this example of all those virtues
he demands of woman?</p>

<p>Strange that these thoughts should have
flashed through my mind. Strange that I
should never before have given Ethel’s personality
a thought.</p>

<p>We kissed Mumsie and passed to our cab.
Uncle cheerily bade us a merry evening. We
bumped away in our sleigh, a covered sleigh,
a cab on runners. It seemed so weird. And
the houses came into light and fell into shadow
in a spectral procession.</p>

<p>The sleigh passed on to parts unknown to
me and soon I noticed the houses were large
and standing far back from the street. They
represented property, position, power.</p>

<p>Our sleigh came to a halt. I saw before us
a line of sleighs and motors stretching from
the street to the portiere of a great stone
mansion pouring out light from a score of
windows. I could see muffled figures hurrying
up the steps into the wide, open doors, and my
heart began to thump. It pounded even
harder as I made my entrance to the great
hall. I expected to make my bow to the host
and hostess and had my best smile ready; but
all that happened was, a maid whispered to
Ethel: “Straight up stairs, please.” Not very
dramatic!</p>

<p>The dressing-room was crowded. Ethel and
I had to wait a long time ere we could have a
look in a glass. The dresses of the women
were gorgeous, some a glitter of transparencies,
others shimmering silk; all the colours—it
was Paradise. There were dresses also
a good deal bolder than the fashion plates.
Chatter was going on all about us, a perfect
Babel.</p>

<p>Of course, there were some girls there with
simple gowns besides ourselves, but they and
we had to wait while the peacocks restored
their plumage. It seemed as if the best dressed
could push the most. This observation, I am
afraid, is worthy of Mr. Bang. How that man
is affecting me! Unconsciously, I find, he is
influencing my thought.</p>

<p>At last Ethel and I were able to go downstairs.
At least the roses Mr. Bang gave me
were as good as those anyone else was wearing,
and I knew that my cheeks were not a
mess of rouge and powder.</p>

<p>At the head of what evidently was the
drawing-room, we found our host and hostess.
We filed in, shook hands, and passed on. I
was astounded, their faces looked so bored.
Mr. Lien alone attempted a mechanical smile,
as he took my hand in his. Mrs. Lien moved
not a muscle. Nor were we treated differently
from the general, for Ethel and I passed to
chairs from which I could watch the reception
of those who came after us.</p>

<p>From my seat I watched Mr. Lien. He was
a small man, stooping, and weak of face and
body. His hair was light, his forehead narrow,
his nose large. When he spoke his head
shook nervously; he was not a thing of beauty.</p>

<p>His hair, where it crowned his forehead, was
twisted into a bustling tuft, which I remembered
was a characteristic of his hockey-playing son.
Evidently the boy inherited his
father’s features, and the bodily strength of
his mother. As I gathered these impressions
Mabel Lien came up to her parents, spoke a
few words and then passed on to the orchestra
in a bow window. A moment later the music
struck up, and in response to it a number of
young men filed into the room, paid their
addresses to their host and hostess and sought
their partners, programmes in hand. Couples
began to waltz. A young man asked Ethel to
dance, and I was alone. Then Mrs. Lien
brought up an awkward-looking youth and
introduced him to me; we waltzed. My partner
danced well enough, but had nothing to
say for himself, and I was glad when the dance
ended. I asked to be taken to Ethel; I felt
very depressed.</p>

<p>I saw Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Townsend, and
Mr. Davidson among the dancers, but they all
failed to see me. I know I can dance if I cannot
skate well. My depression grew. A two-step
followed the waltz; and then another
waltz. The third dance I had with a frivolous
youth, and when it ended I asked him to take
me through the portieres into the hall.</p>

<p>As soon as dances ended I noticed couples
passing through this way as well as into the
conservatory. The more gorgeously decked
women sought the conservatory; the less
ostentatious the hall. Several nooks and sitting-out
places were occupied; and a number
of couples were mounting the stairs. Evidently
there were sitting-out places on the
landing and floor above, but one seat remained
in the lower hall. It was built against the wall
at the head of a stairs, that evidently led into
a basement. My partner and I sat there, and
as we did so, I heard a clatter of voices.</p>

<p>“What is that, what is down there?” I
whispered to my companion.</p>

<p>“That—that is the men’s dressing-room,
really a billiard-room. The fellows down there
are having a fine time, but I don’t drink.” An
odour of tobacco smoke came up the stairway.
Here then was the explanation of the
delinquent youths, whose absence caused the
great number of wall-flowers in the ball-room.</p>

<p>“I should have thought young men accepted
Mrs. Lien’s invitation to make themselves
agreeable to the ladies,” I said. “They could
smoke and drink at home.”</p>

<p>“The fellows think Mrs. Lien is mighty
lucky in getting them at all, and that’s the
way I look at it. I’ve got only one more dance
engaged and then I am going to join ’em too;
dancin’ is too much like work. Do you like
dancin’?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied with but a small spirit of
the enthusiasm I commanded a few hours
earlier. Then curiosity overcame me. My
partner had not engaged his dance with me;
Ethel had brought him up and introduced
him, evidently at his request. If he had the
succeeding dance engaged, he should have had
the one he danced with me engaged too. So
I asked the question frankly.</p>

<p>“Well, you see, I really had the dance engaged
and my girl went off with another fellow.
Of course it was a mistake, but I notice
those mistakes are always made in favour of
some fellow who has more money, or is more
in the swim than the victim, see? So, as I
always think it necessary for appearance sake
to put in a few dances, I wanted to get it over.
That’s why I asked you. I saw you were a
stranger, and with Miss Bassett.”</p>

<p>“The men in the smoking-room have even
less regard for appearances than you have?”
I suggested. I was annoyed, disappointed and
disgusted.</p>

<p>“That’s it; you see Charlie Lien does not
care for dancin’ and those are his friends.”</p>

<p>The music began again and my partner
asked if I would care to be taken back to the
ball-room. This I declined. I wished to be
alone. I realized that I received attention
only at the request of Mrs. Lien, or as a matter
of convenience. Bitterness was upon me,
a bitterness that might have been born of Mr.
Bang’s bitterness. Drat that man! His personality
seems to be overpowering mine! He,
his sayings and moods, are ever cropping up
in my mind. I wish I had never seen him. I
am becoming such a cynic as he.</p>

<p>From my seat I could see into the ball-room
on my right, and the dining-room on my left;
this I surveyed. Upon the table there was a
profusion of dainties and the flowers were
magnificent. Yuletide decorations were festooned
about the ceiling. On the side-board
beyond the table was a great punch-bowl and
I noticed several decanters. Couples passed
into the dining-room and helped themselves
from the punch-bowl, laughing and chatting.
Evidently the exercise was making them
thirsty. I was thirsty myself.</p>

<p>While I watched eagerly, my ears caught
scraps of conversation coming up the stairway.
They all bore upon foot-ball and hockey,
and as time went by the noise became worse.</p>

<p>But nothing could distract my mind from
the bitter thoughts within me, as I watched
the enjoyment of the other girls, the pets of
society, those with the costly and extreme
dresses. Their laughter was so clear, spontaneous
and free, their manners so familiar
and easy. Men were continually passing up
and down from the billiard-room. A footman
went down, and shortly afterwards I heard a
voice say, “I’ll be back in a minute, boys,” and
Charlie Lien came running up the stairs. It
was the first time I had seen him in his own
house. He caught sight of me as he passed
and exclaimed, “Hello!” in a startled way,
and then he laughed. He passed down the
hall to his mother who immediately began to
upbraid him. From my seat in the shade I
had a good view of her every expression.
Charlie did not seem to take things seriously
for he answered flippantly. His mother became
more angry as the altercation proceeded.
Charlie finally broke away and passed to the
ball-room, paused, looked in and then came
down the hall. I thought, and evidently his
mother also, had the same suspicion, that he
was going back to his friends. Picture my
surprise when he stopped before me.</p>

<p>“Say,” he said, “the mater says I am disgracing
myself, that I should look after her
guests. I don’t know anything about dancing
and its her dance and Mabel’s—not mine.”</p>

<p>“I know that,” I answered. “I saw you
play against the Leafs; it was grand.”</p>

<p>His eyes lighted up.</p>

<p>“You did!” he exclaimed. “Say you’re a
nice little girl, will you dance with me?”</p>

<p>“With pleasure,” I answered; “the next
waltz.”</p>

<p>“Good! come and have a drink first.”</p>

<p>He led the way into the dining-room, up to
the punch-bowl. He gave me a drink and took
one himself.</p>

<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Claret cup.”</p>

<p>We both drank. He smacked his lips and
put on a wry face. “Awful trash,” he muttered.
“I’ll improve it,” and he took up a
large flask and emptied it into the punch-bowl.</p>

<p>“What are you doing?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Improving the claret cup.”</p>

<p>“What is that you put into it?”</p>

<p>“Oh nothing, some sherry! Come,” he
demanded.</p>

<p>We waltzed. Whether it was the effect of
the punch or not I don’t know, or whether it
was simply reaction after my depression, but
a new spirit had come over me. We danced
fast and furiously; we suited each other
admirably.</p>

<p>“That was fine,” he exclaimed, as we ceased
with the music. “You are a very nice, little
girl; come and have another drink.”</p>

<p>Back into the dining-room we went, and
despite my refusals, he handed me a glass of
the improved claret cup.</p>

<p>He drank his at a gulp; I sipped mine.</p>

<p>“Drink it, it will do you good,” he commanded.</p>

<p>The effect of the previous glass was still
upon me, the taste of the second was already
tingling through my system. “Drink,” he
enjoined again with a grin. Some boys and
girls were regarding me curiously, laughingly.
I drank. I then caught sight of the
decanter that my companion had emptied
into the punch-bowl. “What a beautiful
decanter!” I remarked, and peered at the
delicate tracings cut into the glass. Among
the branches, leaves and flowers, nymphs and
cupids, I saw the word “Whiskey.” I put
down the glass and took Charlie Lien’s arm
and faced towards the door. He followed my
lead; I wished to gain our old seat.</p>

<p>“Not there,” he whispered, and led me
through the hall, then through the ball-room
and on into the conservatory. My head was
drooping, my brain was in a whirl. He led me
to a secluded seat. The odour of flowers was
in the air. In the uncertain light, however,
my senses seemed clouded, my faculties unbalanced.</p>

<p>He sat, I—flopped, I felt like swooning.</p>

<p>“You are not used to claret cup,” he said.</p>

<p>“That was whiskey you put into the punch-bowl,”
I charged him.</p>

<p>“Just a little,” he protested.</p>

<p>“Just a whole lot.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be all right in a minute or two,”
he whispered and put his arm around me.</p>

<p>I felt dizzy, helpless. I was however conscious
of his drawing me to him and kissing
me.</p>

<p>The blood surged through my head. I felt
my face flush as I had never known it flush
before. Intense with indignation as I was,
the only words I could force from my lips
were:</p>

<p>“Nobody can see us, can they?” What a
fool, fool, fool, I was!</p>

<p>“You can rely on me for that,” and he
kissed me again.</p>

<p>I realized I was drunk—the horror of it!—yet
my mind seemed perfectly clear. I heard
every sound, or thought I did, and all the facts
of my situation came again and again to my
mind. I found myself unable to protect myself
against the indignity put upon me,
although I endeavoured to protest. At length
I managed to mutter.</p>

<p>“You mustn’t kiss me.”</p>

<p>“It’s a shame, isn’t it?” he said laughingly,
and kissed me again.</p>

<p>In my humiliation and weakness I again
pictured my grandfather, the old army officer,
the personification of honour and gentleness,
and the contrast he bore to the skin-flint progenitor
of the cad who had insulted me. With
half a cry I broke from his embrace, and
threw myself as far from him as the seat
allowed.</p>

<p>“You cad,” I breathed.</p>

<p>“Now don’t get cross, its no use; besides
all the girls do it,” he coaxed and cajoled—was
a picture of weakness contemptible.</p>

<p>“They let the men kiss them?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Certainly,—all the girls that have a good
time. After all what harm does a little flirtation
do?”</p>

<p>The explanation strangely assuaged my
anger. “All the girls do it,”—evidently it was
custom. I sank back listless once again. He
made an effort to put his arm around me.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me,” I demanded, and he
made no further attempt. My head getting
increased command over my tongue, I asked
him questions concerning his hockey, how
young he was when he first began to play, etc.
He fell into an easy conversation and soon I
had compelled myself to forget the worst
unpleasantness.</p>

<p>After a little while I suggested that his
mother might be wondering about him.</p>

<p>“Never mind mother; she’ll get over it,”
he protested.</p>

<p>“But we should really go back to the ball-room,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Are you all right?” he asked with a
genuine concern.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” I replied and stood up. I took
his arm and we passed from the conservatory.</p>

<p>“If any of the other girls drink much of
that claret cup, they’ll get—as I was,” I
remarked.</p>

<p>He only laughed.</p>

<p>“But it is not right.”</p>

<p>“Do you want to get on in society?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“I have felt at times I should like to make
friends among nice people,” I replied.</p>

<p>“Well, let me tell you, you can get along
easier by not being too straight-laced, and be
sure you make friends with the men, believe
me. Say, they are having supper, let me be
your cavalier,” and he led the way to the dining-room.</p>

<p>The room was crowded to suffocation. At
one end of the table stood Mr. Lien, while Mrs.
Lien was at the other. Men and women, boys
and girls, were eating sandwiches, cake, ices,
trifles. I caught sight of Ethel. She had a
cup of coffee in her hand and was talking
sedately to her companion; they both were
the picture of propriety.</p>

<p>Charlie Lien elbowed his way to the table
and secured me a plate of chicken and a cup
of coffee. I drank and ate. Charlie was certainly
assiduous, most attentive, trying to
make up for his bad behaviour. I began to
feel pleased with myself. I was indeed in the
fashionable world. Mrs. Lien was a society
leader; I was singled out for special attention
by her son.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from the outer world came the
sounds of successive steam whistles, screeching
and screaming, and a series of explosions.
Mr. Lien held aloft a glass and said, “I wish
you all a very happy New Year.” Everybody
near the table took a glass and drank to
the toast. Charlie Lien thrust one into my
hand. The wine trickled into my soul like the
spirit of infinite joy. A cheer went up and
my voice, I am sure, was as loud as any
other. Somebody began to sing <span class='it'>Should Auld
Acquaintance be Forgot</span>, and in a moment
there was a circle with hands joined singing
round the table, while outside the clamour
continued. And then somebody shouted three
cheers for Mr. and Mrs. Lien, which was
answered by a yell and supported by <span class='it'>For
He’s a Jolly Good Fellow</span>, with which was
blended, <span class='it'>We Won’t go Home Till Morning</span>.</p>

<p>Then came more drinks, more champagne.
This wine I found most stimulating. I was
conscious after a time that the crowd in the
dining-room was much lessened. I sought
Ethel Bassett: she was gone. No doubt she
was suffering from the misfortune of being
respectable. About me were nothing but
fashionable girls and men.</p>

<p>One girl plucked a rose from her breast and
threw it across the table. It hit a man, who
immediately picked it up and threw it back;
that set the bottle rolling. In a moment
flowers were flying everywhere, and soon
pieces of cake were used as missiles, and
sandwiches and what not. Glasses went over
and smashed. The fusillade only ceased when
there was nothing left on the table, that could
be easily thrown. Only then did the clamour
die down, and we fell into silence; and with
the absence of the exhilaration and excitement,
a realization of what we had done, came
over me. Mr. and Mrs. Lien were not to be
seen.</p>

<p>Charlie Lien whispered to me, “Come and
dance.” He was strong, he guided and held
me up. When the dance was over he seated
me in the ball-room and went and brought me
a partner for the succeeding dance, one of his
own friends. This man—I don’t know his
name—danced divinely and treated me in his
conversation and references, as, not a young
girl, but a real woman of the world. I was
Oh! so happy. The dances now were a riot,
men and women sang to the music of the
orchestra as they romped. The orchestra
themselves were exhilarated, and had decorated
themselves, or somebody had decked them
with the flowers arranged about the bow window.
Once beautiful plants were in ruin.</p>

<p>Dance followed dance, and I had no lack of
partners: men I had seen dancing with Miss
Mount, and Mabel Lien herself, came to me.
My satisfaction was complete. I was happy.
For once I was completely happy—and in
society.</p>

<p>One of my partners happened to seat me
near two demure maidens, who were without
partners and evidently lacked admiration. I
am afraid I didn’t feel as sympathetic as I
ought.</p>

<p>“I have just come down from the dressing-room,”
I heard one say. “The boys have got
into the nursery and thrown things around
simply awful. I looked in at the door. One
was trying to sit on a rocking horse and broke
it. Another was buffeting his friend with the
mattress torn from a child’s cot. I saw Percy
Jenkins put his foot through a drum; and
dolls and animals were smashed and thrown
all over the place.</p>

<p>“My!” exclaimed the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think this drinking is just horrible.
I hear that one of the footmen, a Scotchman,
who was himself drunk, emptied champagne
into the claret cup.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard it’s awfully risky to mix
drinks.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and if news of this gets out I know
Mother will never let me go to a New Year’s
party again.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” I thought, “how am I to get
home, what will Ethel Bassett think?” Would
she tell her mother or Mumsie? What would
Mumsie say if she knew I had taken glasses
of champagne and claret cup? I felt in my
bones that Ethel would be hunting me out
soon. We had ordered our cab for half-past
one. There was nothing for me to do but to
speak to Charlie Lien about Ethel. So I asked
my partner to ask him to come to me, which
he soon did.</p>

<p>“I know Miss Bassett will wish to go on
time,” Charlie declared. “I noticed she had
no partner the last dance. And she’s a nice
girl too. If you feel shaky you had better
take a little more champagne.”</p>

<p>“Not more!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Yes, more, it will straighten you up. Be
sure you don’t talk too much and tell her a
drunken footman emptied champagne into the
claret cup and that you innocently took some.
She’s a decent girl.”</p>

<p>“You started that story,” I cried.</p>

<p>“Yes—why?”</p>

<p>I preferred not to answer, and am glad now
that I didn’t answer.</p>

<p>We stood in a corner of the dining-room,
sipping champagne, very little I took.</p>

<p>“I’d like to see you again,” and he looked
smilingly into my eyes. “Will you come and
have tea with me some day?”</p>

<p>I felt brave and answered, “Yes.”</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>I thought a moment.</p>

<p>“On Monday.”</p>

<p>“Not till then?” His voice was full of
solicitude.</p>

<p>“I must stay in to-morrow with Mumsie,
Mrs. Travers, the day after to-morrow is Sunday;
Monday is the first possible day, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>“Where can I meet you?”</p>

<p>“Wherever you suggest.”</p>

<p>“Horace’s, at three.”</p>

<p>“Very well, Horace’s at three o’clock,” I
agreed.</p>

<p>“And now good-night.” His arm went
about me once more and he kissed me even
passionately. I felt all a flutter of emotion;
can that have been passion too? I believe I
should have been disappointed had he not
kissed me.</p>

<p>We passed into the hall and sure enough I
saw Ethel evidently in search of me. We
went to her, I mastering myself the best I
could. A waltz was playing. I was delighted
when my companion begged, “Just let us
finish this waltz.”</p>

<p>And away we went once more.</p>

<p>With the ending of the waltz, which I
enjoyed to the full, I was anxious as to how I
should appear in Ethel’s eyes. I determined
to be in good spirits and prayed that she would
see it only as the effect of dancing. How I
got upstairs and into my things I don’t know.
I remembered what Ethel said to Mrs. Lien,
as we said good-bye; but not what I myself
said. After that my mind is much of a blank.
Am sure that I found myself telling the story
of the drunken footman as directed, and that
an infinite relief came over me when I found
that neither Mumsie or Uncle had stayed up
for my return.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>New Year’s Day.</span></span></p>

<p>Oh! what a headache I had this morning,
the terror of it will remain with me as long
as I live. My whole brain seemed one ache,
a swollen brain, all turned into ache. And
the thirst I had! It too, was almost tangible,
material.</p>

<p>And my conscience, that conscience that I
have heard makes cowards of us all, came
preaching at me. A great terror haunted me;
it seemed to be smothering me. I had to face
Uncle and Mumsie, I, who had been—drunk!
What would they say if they knew; could they
read it in my face; could they read anything
there? How ashamed and unhappy I felt!</p>

<p>I placed my hand on my forehead, as if to
keep my head from bursting. Then I glanced
at the clock on the dressing-table. A quarter
to ten. But that was all right. Mumsie told
me to lie in bed as long as I liked after the
ball. I pressed my throbbing temples and
thought and thought. I reviewed the history
of the night before till my mind focussed on
one object, one face, Charlie Lien. I saw the
bristling tuft of dirty, yellow hair upon his
forehead, his narrow, weak forehead, his
prominent and pimpled nose, his protruding
upper lip, his ever-open mouth, heard his
croaking laughter. Oh! to think I had allowed
that beast of a man to kiss me. I felt an agony
of humiliation; as if I, my person, had been
polluted. I had allowed him to kiss me—and
that last kiss—I had expected it. I did not
guard against it. The shame to me! .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
What a cad the man was; in his mother’s house—to
act so towards a guest. I found relief in
tears. I cried.</p>

<p>Tears eased my headache, but I knew it
would not do to allow my eyes to tell tales, so
I arose and bathed my face.</p>

<p>I realized that by no earthly process, at this
early date, could Mumsie and Uncle have
heard any accounts of the ball, and that my
cowardice was but the child of a guilty conscience.
But this assurance I gave myself
inspired a greater question. What was the
chance of their eventually learning the truth?
If they were likely to hear the story through
the ordinary process of gossip, had I not
better make at least some small confession of
it. If I said nothing, and later they were to
hear a wild story of our doings, what would
they say? I dressed myself quickly and
passed quietly down the stairs.</p>

<p>“Happy New Year,” I chirped to Uncle as
I peeped into his den.</p>

<p>“Good-morning, little mouse,” responded
dear Uncle, putting down the <span class='it'>Telegraph</span> and
turning his kind face to me. “I have just
been reading the account of the ball. You
have not been neglected by the imaginative
reporter.”</p>

<p>I felt a qualm of anxiety and then of keen
curiosity, as I walked over to Uncle and he
drew me to sit upon the arm of his chair. He
read the account of the ball. My name was
mentioned as that of one of the “buds,” who
had received marked attention. Having satisfied
my curiosity, Uncle told me he had waited
breakfast for me and led the way to the dining-room.
Mumsie came in and kissed me tenderly,
and wished me the compliments of the
season. I was glad Mr. Bang was away.</p>

<p>“Now, Elsie,” began Uncle, “tell us all
about your experiences.”</p>

<p>“I had a lovely time, perfectly delightful,”
I said, with as much semblance of delight as
I could muster. My temples were throbbing
violently.</p>

<p>“That’s good. What did you say to the
men, when they came crowding to be introduced?
They must have seen you were my
niece by adoption?”</p>

<p>“Don’t answer him, Elsie,” cut in Mumsie
and turning to me, “He’s an awful tease, this
Micawber of mine.”</p>

<p>“Did you begin to make conversation, like
the gentle maiden who said to each new
acquaintance, ‘I had a little kitten and it
died.’ ” Uncle imitated a little girl’s voice.</p>

<p>“Oh Uncle,” I protested, “I’m not so green
as that, surely!”</p>

<p>“I told you to pay no attention to him: quit—”
and Mumsie made to throw a napkin
across the table at her husband.</p>

<p>But I was really delighted, for Uncle’s mood
gave me reassurance and Mumsie’s threat to
throw her napkin at her Micawber inspired me
to broach the subject of the riot at the ball. I
told of the girls throwing flowers, whereat
Uncle pricked up his ears, and soon I had
given them a mild account of what happened.</p>

<p>“I heard,” and I spoke with great seriousness,
“that someone, one of the servants, put
champagne in the claret cup.”</p>

<p>“I hope you did not take any of it,” Mumsie
said, her voice in alarm.</p>

<p>“I had a glass before the champagne was
added,” I replied, my heart in my mouth.</p>

<p>“Does she look as if she had been on the
bat, does she talk as if this were the morning
after?” Uncle asked his wife in kind mockery.</p>

<p>How grateful I felt to Uncle! Mumsie,
however, did not respond to her husband’s
raillery as readily as I could have wished.
This troubled me, left me full of doubts. I
went to my room as quickly as I could.</p>

<p>The last words Uncle said to me were that
if his memory were good and his experience
counted for anything, I would not feel as
played out to-day, as I would to-morrow. Of
course, Uncle was not figuring on the wine,
what he meant was the effect of the late hours
and excitement. It struck me that if I had a
worse headache to-morrow than I had to-day,
I would die of it.</p>

<p>On returning to my room, I threw myself
on my unmade bed and worried. I must break
with this Charlie Lien. I must write him a
letter telling him it would not be right for me
to meet him, and intimating what my sober
senses thought of his familiarity with me.</p>

<p>But how could I word it: it might fall into
some other body’s hands. His mother might
open my letter by mistake—awful thought!</p>

<p>Oh! what a day of misery has been this New
Year’s day!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>Sunday, January 2nd.</span></span></p>

<p>My conscience is darker than ever, it is
really oppressive. I went to church in the
morning. I prayed, I asked for strength and
wisdom. But I really don’t think I would
have gone, had it not been that I wished to
meet Ethel Bassett, so that I might judge by
her manner, as to the impression I had made
during the ball and after. I felt that if she
were pleasant to me, my conduct would not
have been so bad.</p>

<p>At breakfast and on the way to church I
could not raise a single jest from Mumsie. I
know it is only my conscience, that Mumsie is
not cross with me, does not dream anything
of my doings. But oh, if I could only read in
black and white that she truly thinks, so that
there would not be the tiniest little bit of
doubt about it.</p>

<p>What a relief it was after church to come
upon Ethel Bassett and her mother, and
receive from each of them a cheery smile. I
fairly fell upon Ethel: I wanted to get her to
myself and confide in her. And I did, I told
her that my conscience was troubling me. I
poured out abuse upon the legendary drunken
footman, and dilated upon the awfulness of
my having drunk a glass of claret cup to which
champagne had been added.</p>

<p>Ethel smiled, and dimpled her cheeks so
prettily that I felt I could have fallen on her
neck and wept. At that moment I felt I could
have fallen at her feet. And when she
remarked in her shy way, on my mentioning
my conscience: “But you know it is said we
must not humour our conscience too much,”
I nearly wept.</p>

<p>In fact, when I rejoined Mumsie, I realized
that her tardiness in responding to my efforts
at inspiring levity was the result of her being
temporarily out of sorts. For she was talking
with Mrs. Bassett at a great rate.</p>

<p>After our Sunday dinner (mid-day) I
returned to my room and sat by the window.
I had much to think about. I realized my
conscience troubled me chiefly and more persistently
as danger threatened. Danger
removed, my soul was less troubled. Moralizing
so, I deemed I had mastered philosophy,
that I was philosophical and my self-esteem
and confidence increased. But for Charlie
Lien I had a real detestation and repugnance.
He was an utter beast. I must write him a
letter refusing to meet him to-morrow. How
shall I word it?</p>

<p>I took pen and paper and wrote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“My dear Mr. Lien,—</p>

<p>“I am very sorry to have to disappoint
you in my engagement to take tea with you to-morrow.
I find———”</p>

</div>

<p>No excuse would frame itself in my mind.
I thought of pleading a forgotten pre-engagement
but put this aside as unworthy. My
pride rose. I tore the letter into bits and sat
again by the window. I found Uncle’s
prophecy had come true. I felt really more
tired to-day than yesterday. My brain refused
to work. I strove to recall my doings since
first I came under Uncle’s roof, my aims and
aspirations, and my efforts towards attaining
them, but my brain seemed muddled. I could
not think systematically or with any decent
effect.</p>

<p>Then I had an inspiration. It struck me a
letter such as I should write to Charlie Lien
should be written in the third person. Again
I took up my pen and wrote:</p>

<p>“Miss Travers begs to be excused from
keeping her engagement with Mr. Charlie Lien
on Monday afternoon.”</p>

<p>Just as I stamped the envelope, Mumsie
came to the door and said Uncle wanted me to
go for a walk. I slipped the letter into my
muff and dressed hurriedly.</p>

<p>Mumsie did not come with us, pleading a
headache. I was half glad, half sorry. We
walked through the city for several miles.
Uncle did the talking, I had little to say. I
could not get my mind off the letter in my
muff. We passed a score of post boxes: but
when we returned home I still was in possession
of the letter. Before going to bed I tore
it up.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 3rd.</span></span></p>

<p>I feel I have irretrievably thrown in my lot
with Charlie Lien and his set. I found my
course with them to-day so easy, they took me
to themselves so quickly. It was all so simple.
As I came away from the King Henry-the-Eighth
Hotel, I felt my head was high in the
air. We met Polly Townsend and I bowed
to him in the most patronizing manner I could
command and got a profound return. After
all, the Skating Club crowd are a sloppy
crowd, as Charlie says—namby-pamby men
and bread-and-butter maidens.</p>

<p>I struggled hard not to keep my appointment,
but at the time arranged found myself
at Horace’s. Charlie was there, buying a tie.
He took me in hand immediately and we
crossed the street to the Henry-the-Eighth. I
had seen it before, of course, a great tall building
mounting to the sky, but did not know it
was an hotel. We entered a door that seemed
very small for such a great building, but I
have since learned this is the “Ladies’ Entrance.”
We had no sooner entered the passage-way
inside than we passed into the
elevator and Charlie gave orders for the Palm-room.
We mounted a dozen feet only, and
stopped, the man opened the cage door, we
turned round a corner, and were in a low
room filled with cigarette-smoke, and some
palms and easy chairs and tables. In an
instant I took in these surroundings and the
people present. Several tables were about,
each occupied by a man and girl. Some of the
men were old with coarse faces, and some were
young and sallow. I could judge little or
nothing of the men. Some of the women were
not young, and their faces were of a type I
had only before seen on the street. They were
unhealthy and unwholesome looking. I am
sure I could not make friends with them. To
me they were repulsive. The young girls all
wore extreme costumes, and some were much
made-up. Paint and powder were thrown on
them. They also were distasteful to me. What
sort of a place had I got into? And the
thought struck me that an outsider looking
down upon us must have found me in my
simple and plain attire, conspicuous by contrast.</p>

<p>A waiter came to our table and stood
expectant.</p>

<p>“What will you have?” asked my host.</p>

<p>I picked up a card and made a show of
looking at it and replied, “An ice.”</p>

<p>“Two plain ice creams, and two Manhattan
cocktails,” ordered Charlie.</p>

<p>I gasped: cocktails! I had often heard of
them as being a man’s drink. I did not wish
to drink a cocktail.</p>

<p>“Not a cocktail for me,” I protested; but
already the waiter was gone.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” laughed my host in his
discordant way. “You needn’t drink it, if
you don’t want to.” How his croaking laugh
jarred on me! I felt positively frightened.</p>

<p>“What will the other people think?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“What do you care what they think?”
retorted my companion. “Besides nobody
here knows you, and besides here it is the custom.”</p>

<p>“The custom!” “All the girls do it!” These
phrases again passed through my mind, but
did not assuage my fears as my indignation
had been assuaged in Mrs. Lien’s conservatory
on Friday night.</p>

<p>“Do you wish to make a drunkard of me?”
I asked, finding fortitude I know not where.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he demanded almost crossly,
“you say you want to get into our set. The
people whose guests you are, are not rich; you
are not rich. You have nothing to give except
your own good company and the pleasure one
may find in your companionship. I have
taken a fancy to you, feel as if I would like
to be kind to you. I am ready to introduce
you to my friends and give you a good time,
but the girls I know, and who are my friends,
are not Puritans. They take an occasional
drink, they smoke cigarettes, on the whole they
enjoy themselves.”</p>

<p>Charlie Lien paused as if for want of words,
but I did not take the opportunity to speak,
as indeed there was nothing to say. I suppose
he was trying to find words to intimate that
those who ask of others must be prepared to
give. Could I have got away, withdrawn at
this point, undoubtedly I would have done so.
I lacked courage, however, to make the breach
openly.</p>

<p>“Come and sit with us,” I heard Charlie
call out, and I saw a lady with a boy of
Charlie’s age making towards us. Charlie
stood up and handed the lady to a seat. They
were introduced to me, Iris Carey and Basil
Locke. I was startled out of my boots almost,
as I heard my companion say, “Miss Travers
is from England.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord,” I mused. “What does this
mean?”</p>

<p>The waiter now appeared with our ices. “Ice
cream good for you?” enquired Charlie of
them, and being so assured he repeated his
earlier order.</p>

<p>The two new-comers were evidently on the
most familiar terms with Charlie. I was
ignored for the moment, and an animated conversation
sprang up in which each addressed
the other by the Christian name. The conversation
bore upon the Hunt Club and motoring;
and was doubtless a measure of high life.
At a pause Miss Carey turned to me and asked.</p>

<p>“Have you been long in Canada?”</p>

<p>“Some time, and I like it immensely.”</p>

<p>This seemed to please her; so my embarrassment
passed.</p>

<p>“English people always accuse us of asking
them how they like our country: you have evidently
learned to forestall the question,” she
remarked. These words seemed to me surprising
from one whose conversation a moment
before had been so flippant. I was glad she
did not continue that line, but came under the
necessity of answering Charlie Lien. For one
thing my embarrassment was great, and for
another I wished to observe her.</p>

<p>Irish Carey is a tall, willowy girl with a long
neck. She is dark and her complexion very
bright. Her cheeks were undoubtedly rouged.
Her forehead is high, bold and very white;
her mouth small as is her chin. How I envied
her her command of chatter. I suppose the
ability to chatter is a gift, I find it impossible
even to transcribe it, so how can I hope to
copy it?</p>

<p>In Basil Locke, I observed a slight youth
with a pale and narrow face. He had a deliberate
way of speaking, a drawl. And he did
not have much to say, the chatter being chiefly
between Miss Carey and Charlie.</p>

<p>When we had finished our ices, or even a
little before, Basil produced a cigarette-case
and passed it to me. I took one and my heart
fell into my boots. I toyed with it, Miss Carey
took a cigarette as did each of the men.
Charlie Lien struck a match and held it
towards me. I was smoking before I knew
it. I saw Charlie regarding me, evidently
with approval.</p>

<p>My cocktail was still untouched, when the
men had finished theirs and Iris’s glass was
half empty. Charlie noticed this, caught my
eye and then glanced at the glass. I drank a
little to counteract the effect of the cigarette,
and then smoked to counteract the drink. And
then I talked because I felt like talking.</p>

<p>What I talked about, what we all talked
about for an hour and a half I don’t know,
except that my friends did not favour balls,
to which their own set was not asked, or at
which the hostess did not provide wine. From
all they said about what each had done or was
doing, or intended to do, I could gather but
little and can remember less.</p>

<p>Before we left the hotel Miss Carey suggested
that I be shown the drawing-room of the
hotel and Charlie invited me to come with
him. We went up a few steps and soon were
among great pillars and pictured, and hangings,
and things, and big upholstered chairs, in
which sat couples, who became strangely silent
on our approach. I took advantage of an
opportunity to ask Charlie why he had introduced
me as English.</p>

<p>“Why! because you look English. Besides,”
and he spoke slowly, “dressed as you
are, or are not, as a Canadian girl you would
hardly do for our set.” We were in a passage-way.
Charlie turned round and looked behind
him. Instinctively I knew what was coming:
he put his arm about me and kissed me. I felt
that I was being put to the test, my acquiescence
meant I accepted him as my friend with
all that went with it. My refusal meant a final
break and a hum-drum existence. I feel I am
drifting, that I have ceased to have any power
to select where I shall next place my foot. I
have gone so far, I feel I cannot turn back.
One good thing is that the idea of being untrue
to Mumsie and Uncle troubles me less. I
argue to myself that many girls, Iris Carey,
for instance, must deceive somebody. And,
after all, if all one reads and hears is true,
there must be a vast number of naughty people
in the world. Charlie has promised to motor
Iris, Basil and me out to the Hunt Club to-morrow.</p>

<p>On arrival home I did not give any account
of my doings to Mumsie. But I will have to
patch up some story for to-morrow. I don’t
like it, but I must lie. What can I invent?</p>

<p>I settled down to my seat at dinner with a
positive feeling of satisfaction in Mr. Bang’s
presence, and by my plate, I found a handsome
copy of <span class='it'>The Vicar of Wakefield</span> inscribed
as a New Year’s gift to me from him.
I had read the book and told him so.</p>

<p>“Long ago?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, “Father asked me to read
it years ago.” In reality it was three or four
years ago.</p>

<p>“You will read it again just to please me,”
he pleaded.</p>

<p>I agreed to do so. Uncle asked him some
question bearing upon his business in Toronto.
I was glad of this as it prevented any question
being fired at me as to my afternoon’s
doings, and I could use my brain planning how
to keep such a question from being asked. I
determined to get Mr. Bang and Uncle talking
and to keep them talking. So when a pause
came, I asked Uncle, “What is a Puritan?”
little dreaming of what a flood-gate I would
turn loose.</p>

<p>“A Puritan! Who has been calling you a
Puritan?” demanded Uncle.</p>

<p>I was just going to reply that I had heard
of one girl at Mrs. Lien’s ball speaking of
another as a Puritan, and wished to know
exactly what was meant. All this, of course,
would have been half lies—for I was the girl—but
I must lie it seems as things are going.
Mr. Bang saved the necessity.</p>

<p>“Now-a-days a Puritan is considered as an
overly good person whom in business dealings,
it is necessary to watch,” he growled.</p>

<p>Uncle smiled and agreed.</p>

<p>“The Puritans most famous in our history
are those who settled in New England in the
early 17th century as you know———” he
began.</p>

<p>“They were a bad lot,” cut in J. B., “far
from what their name would imply, so you see
to be called a Puritan now can hardly be
accepted as a term of respect.”</p>

<p>“Were they very bad?” I asked, inwardly
rejoicing at the success of my strategy.</p>

<p>“Their chief recreation was hanging Quakers,
Episcopalians, and Papists; they, together
with the descendants of twenty
thousand odd convicts, and other scum that
England had dumped into the New World.
Such were the ‘Fathers of the Revolution’ in
the great Republic.”</p>

<p>“Twenty thousand convicts is not many in
a big nation,” Mumsie suggested. She always
wants to bolster up any bad case.</p>

<p>“The total immigration to the American
Colonies before the revolution was one hundred
thousand, out of which grew the three
million people constituting the population at
that time,” Mr. Bang replied, looking severely
at his aunt, “and then the British Government
swept the streets of their large cities to
find these people wives.”</p>

<p>I noticed that as Mr. Bang said this, he
brushed together a number of crumbs on the
table cloth in a significant manner.</p>

<p>“Jack! what a thing to say, and before the
child!” Mumsie protested. “The Child,”
indeed!</p>

<p>“If she doesn’t hear worse among the Liens
and Mounts than anything she does from me,
she will be lucky,” retorted the amiable one:
“besides” he continued, “the version taught
in our schools of the causes that led to the
American Revolution is the only version that
could justify the world’s greatest robbery,
perpetuated by the most virulent set of utter,
damned scoundrels the world has ever
known.” He looked like a turkey-cock in his
trumpetting indignation.</p>

<p>“Don’t start another revolution,” cried
Mumsie, shocked.</p>

<p>It quieted Mr. Bang. He continued in more
moderate tones.</p>

<p>“No doubt these women were included in
the one hundred thousand. If you read Mary
Johnson’s book, <span class='it'>To Have and to Hold</span>, you
will see there written that one shipload of
wives was warranted honest, but this I fancy
we may put down to the bias and prejudice
of the author.”</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“For the simple reason that to-day the
serving women<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a> of England are reluctant to
come to Canada to receive double the pay they
receive at home. When you consider that a
hundred years ago, a passage across the
Atlantic was looked upon with horror and
undertaken in terror, and that in the seventeenth
century the danger of being tomahawked
by the Indians in the colonies was
very real, you will understand that honest
maids did not then so seek to espouse honest
convicts.”</p>

<p>“In old colonial days,” said Uncle, “crossing
the Atlantic in sailing ships was a fearful
ordeal. Our family legends are full of stories
of its terrors.”</p>

<p>“Tell her of old Aunt Havelock,” suggested
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“What of her?” I said. I preferred anecdotes
to Mr. Bang’s jeremiads.</p>

<p>“Aunt Havelock was my aunt; Jack’s great
aunt. She was crossing from England in a
sailing ship sometime between 1830 and 1840.
The steward gave her a plate one day that had
not been properly washed. She handed it to
him, saying, ‘Sandy, this plate is not clean.’
The honest Scot took it, looked at it disdainfully
and spat upon it, rubbed it with his
apron, and handed it back to her.”</p>

<p>I shuddered. So did Mumsie. Horrid!</p>

<p>“I remember Aunt Havelock, when I was a
small boy playing at her feet, a lady of excellent
refinement, a model of the old school,”
said Mr. Bang. “She had the most gentle,
and sweetest voice I ever heard. When you
consider, what she, an army officer’s wife, had
to put up with, you can conceive what the
treatment of the serving classes would be. No,
No,” and Mr. Bang shook his head, “not many
of the maids that went to Virginia as wives
were honest.”</p>

<p>We were still a long way from the nuts and
raisins. I was dreading lest Mumsie turned
the conversation. What would be more
natural, if she wished to do so, than for her
to ask, “Elsie, what did you do with yourself
this afternoon?” I shuddered at the thought.
I must keep Mr. Bang talking.</p>

<p>“You think then, Mr. Bang, that no person
came to America unless he had to?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly,” he replied. “Few leave
England permanently to-day unless necessity
compels. And the chief argument against the
stories of the Fourth of July orators is that
the lukewarm Briton, who comes to reside in
Canada immediately turns into a redhot
Imperialist. Human nature was the same yesterday,
as it is to-day. It is against nature
for any normal body of Englishmen to do
what the Yankees did, no matter what the
provocation.”</p>

<p>“But there were Englishmen who revolted.”
I suggested.</p>

<p>“Puritanism was doubtless an expression
of religious insanity,” he replied with
fervour, “and then what child would believe
his father a felon? The children of felons
invariably believe their fathers the victims of
oppression. No doubt the Yankee children
were taught of bloody kings and dukes and
earls—and of feudal oppression. Such
legends are current even to-day. The highest
expression of Yankee humour is that wherein
the western bully spits tobacco juice on the
patent-leather boots of the eastern dandy.
Class intolerance is still active in Yankee
land.”</p>

<p>“Jack’s quite right there,” put in Uncle.</p>

<p>“I’ve never known you to find him wrong.”</p>

<p>“Now Auntie,” pleaded Mr. Bang, “you
know I have had special opportunities of studying
the Yanks. Besides they are re-writing
their history. One old gentleman of Boston
wrote up the history of the Loyalists of his
state, and incidentally showed the majority of
those who signed the Declaration of Independence
to be unspeakable scoundrels. Their
descendants, I am told, beat the poor old man
up and wrecked his home. And then <span class='it'>The True
American Revolution</span>, goes into all the harrowing
details and shows that the story of the
wrongs inflicted upon the colonies was more
invention to justify the atrocities committed.”</p>

<p>“Canada is loyal,” said Mumsie soothingly.</p>

<p>“Canada is loyal and Canada’s loyalty is
the wonder of the age,” commented Uncle.</p>

<p>“Why?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why! think of what our forefathers suffered,
the Loyalists!” cried Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“The revolutionaries were only one-third of
the population of the colonies,” Uncle replied.
“These people banded themselves together,
transgressed every moral law against those
who would not renounce their lawful kind,
tarred and feathered innocent officials, ill-treated
their wives and daughters. The houses
of Loyalists were broken into and destroyed;
and while the faithful patiently waited the
happy day when law and order would be
established, Whig eloquence sounded platitudes
in the British House of Commons.”
Uncle was almost as serious about it as Mr.
Bang.</p>

<p>“I always think,” said that worthy, “that
history should recognize as a supreme token
of the righteousness of British rule in the
colonies, the fact that many of the unfortunate
followers of Prince Charlie in the rebellion of
Forty-five, who went to America, sided with
King George.” Turning to me, Mr. Bang
continued, “Little Partner, if you read the
mournful tales of the persecutions that followed
the battle of Culloden, you will agree
that Major MacDonald, the husband of the
gentle Flora, had little cause to love the House
of Hanover.”</p>

<p>“Loyalty, Elsie,” said Uncle, “is best considered
as an expression of ancestor worship.
I can make nothing else out of it.”</p>

<p>“The Englishman comes out to Canada and
hears himself spoken of as a ‘damn fool of an
Englishman,’ ” added Mr. Bang, “and therefore
concludes his country is not popular.
Uncle’s definition of loyalty is as good as any
other.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang had one other idea he could not
restrain.</p>

<p>“If you wish for a definition of the Yankee
you will find it on the old revolutionary banner.”</p>

<p>“What was that,” I asked.</p>

<p>“A coiled rattle-snake—the snake in the
grass. That’s the Yankee. That’s the animal
the statesmen of Britain toady to, and yet we
love England still.” And Mr. Bang smiled,
and actually his smile was not cynical.</p>

<p>“What about taxation without representation?”
asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Largely advanced subsequent to Independence,”
explained Mr. Bang. “England
fought France and took Canada to prevent the
raiding of New England’s frontiers. This
cost England seven hundred million dollars.
The colonies were rolling in prosperity, but
when asked to meet a portion of the cost,
according to their agreement, they evaded the
issue. They guessed England would be an
easier mark than France, and they guessed
rightly. But this was only because the Lord
in his inscrutable scheme created the Whig.”</p>

<p>“Is the Whig such a very dreadful person?”
asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“The Whigs instigated indirectly the Yankee
Revolution. That brought on the French
Revolution, for the war of the American
Revolution cost France more than it did the
Yankees, and the oppressive taxation to pay
for France’s participation in it incidentally
brought about her Reign of Terror. This in
turn evoked Napoleon and his twenty-five
years of war. Surely that is a sufficiently
heavy score?”</p>

<p>“You might add the War of 1812,” suggested
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly; when the Yanks thought
they saw Napoleon winning, the master of
Europe, they attacked Canada, believing their
success assured and that they could so curry
favour with the despot, Napoleon in Elba.
They signed a treaty of peace in which no
mention was made of the ostensible cause of
the war, namely, the right to search on the
high seas. Yet they teach in their schools that
they fought the War of Independence for the
principle of ‘No taxation without representation,’
and they call the War of 1812 their
second war of independence.”</p>

<p>“A Whig must indeed be a very dreadful
person,” I remarked in glee. I have stumbled
on a way to keep myself from being asked
questions, and the opportunity to denounce
anything—anything, and everything, and
everybody—seems to bring joy to Mr. Bang.
After all one does good when one gives pleasure.
“What was a Whig?” I asked.</p>

<p>“One whose instincts were good and understanding
bad,” replied Uncle.</p>

<p>“A political Jesuit,” suggested Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“The ancestor of the Scottish Grit, in Canada,
and the Liberal in England,” Mumsie
explained.</p>

<p>Of course, I did not understand quite all
this, but it did not affect my enjoyment. Such
talk is very stimulating.</p>

<p>“The Whig or what he has developed into,”
said Mr. Bang, “is a dangerous being. Gladstone
forsook Gordon and laid the seeds of
trouble in the Transvaal; and as the Whig
party caused the American Revolution, so are
Whiggish principles leading to the impending
war in Europe.”</p>

<p>“Why?” enquired Mumsie quite seriously.</p>

<p>“Because the Germans think they can bamboozle
England as the Yankees did, and
because, were the Tories in power in England,
they would bring commercial ruin to their
European rival.”</p>

<p>“But,” said Mumsie, “Germany may be
guiltless of bad intentions.”</p>

<p>“Auntie,” almost thundered Mr. Bang,
“once in Alaska, I had a German as mining
partner. We slept under the same blanket
for months. I learned to read the German
mind. The frugal German is not putting
countless millions into armament without
believing he will get a return. I have also
travelled in Germany.”</p>

<p>“This is then why you think regeneration
of our society is at hand?” asked Mumsie,
doubtless referring to Mr. Bang’s suggestion
of many nights previous. Oh, how long ago it
seems!</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it. A great war will come when
England will have to strain every muscle.
Then let us hope our women folk turn from
those who trifle with them, and spend their
money on them, to those who defend them.”</p>

<p>Dinner ended with no bones broken. In
fact, we were all in very good humour. I made
the excuse of a headache and slipped away to
my room. Soon my joy left me, my head
became filled with difficult thoughts. Laughter,
I believe, is not a measure of the joy
within me, not always. I believe I now
laughed in an attempt to induce joy, not as an
expression of it.</p>

<p>I have decided to tell Mumsie that I have
an engagement for to-morrow afternoon to go
shopping and take tea with some fictitious person.
This I believe to be the safest device.
Should I say Ethel Bassett for instance,
Mumsie might find out I fibbed, which would
look bad. I can say I met Hannah Smart at
Mrs. Lien’s ball. I know there is no real
Hanna Smart. What a sneak I feel—and am.</p>

It may interest old country people to learn that servants
coming to Canada generally expect to take their meals with
the family, or enjoy other social advancements.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 4th.</span></span></p>

<p>This morning Mumsie received a letter from
Sister Mary intimating that she would arrive
by the day train. “It is so good of you to
think I should like to see dear Jack, and I am
so proud Uncle wishes the children to come.”
The new-comer would stay just for a few days.
Brother Jack opined that she really meant
this, as she could do a world of shopping in a
few hours. Mumsie and I decided that she
and the children should have my room, and
that I should occupy the sewing-room as temporary
quarters.</p>

<p>During breakfast Mr. Bang seemed more
than usually intent on reading the <span class='it'>Telegraph</span>.
In the process he read aloud: “Sir Thomas
Billings returned yesterday from a visit over
the lines of the Poverty, Distress and Want
System. He reports the company’s affairs in
a particularly prosperous condition, and in
answer to a question inferred that the stock is
due for a substantial rise.”</p>

<p>“That’s what might be called a straight
tip,” laughed Uncle, “written in very poor
journalese.”</p>

<p>“According to Timkins the process of making
money in the circumstances is easy. The
fourth of January, too,” mused Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Nothing more was said. I went into the
drawing-room to look over my New Year’s
gift. I became absorbed in it, until I was
startled by hearing Mr. Bang’s voice at the
telephone.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Timkins? This is Bang
speaking.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“I see Tom’s red hot tip in the <span class='it'>Telegraph</span>.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s pretty coarse. I think I may as
well have a little easy money as let you make
it all. Please have your broker sell a hundred
shares in the Poverty, Distress and Want on
my account.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“No, a hundred is enough for me. I’m not
in your class, you know.”</p>

<p> * * * * *</p>

<p>“Very good, thank you. I am going to
walk down town for the exercise. Will look
in and see you.”</p>

<p>The receiver was hung up. Mr. Bang and
Uncle left the house together en route to the
city, and I was left to my thoughts and <span class='it'>The
Vicar of Wakefield</span>. I soon became interested
in the book, reading passages here and there,
and examining the illustrations. As I glanced
over the pages the story came back to me, the
fine old Vicar and his foolish wife, the girls
who wished to see “high life,” and their
numerous disappointments, with Olivia’s
tragic danger. “High Life!”—an inspiration
flashed upon me. As I have said I am getting
into Mr. Bang’s processes of reasoning. I am
beginning to use his own philosophy against
himself. No person can tell me that he fell
upon this book haphazard, or because the
binding was handsome, and the illustrations
charming and clever. Oh, no, not Mr. Bang!
He is quite too serious a person for that. Not
only does he take it upon himself to out do
Uncle in the effort to mould my mind, but
essays to lecture me by the pen of Oliver Goldsmith.
Mr. Bang, I believe I’m a match for
you now.</p>

<p>My eyes caught the lines:</p>


          <div class='poetry-container' style=''>
          <div class='lgp'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class='stanza-outer'>
<p class='line0'>“When lovely woman stoops to conquer.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p>I felt stunned. The significance of the song
struck me as a blow. I had forgotten the lines,
now they are established in my memory. Perhaps
it was that I might fall upon those few
words that prompted the gift of the volume.
I wonder! And then, possibly Mr. Bang has
found out I was in the Henry-the-Eighth
yesterday. Oh dear! Oh dear! this conscience
of mine does keep preaching. I do wish it
would keep quiet. The only thing to do is not
to let my mind dwell upon the past. The
future—that’s it—the bright, beautiful, jolly,
glorious future. I went on with the book. I
read the story of George and his wanderings.
It inspired thoughts of Mr. Bang. I was
going to ask Mr. Bang’s opinion on George’s
wanderings. Possibly a wanderer may be the
best judge of a wanderer’s story.</p>

<p>I had just come to the realization that it
was time to hunt Mumsie up and tell her the
story I had framed, when she came into the
drawing-room—on a tour of inspection. Her
face seemed so open, so genuine, so good, so
motherly that my heart sank. I felt I could
not tell her a lie. “Well, dear,” was her only
greeting as she came into the room, looking
like radiant love. I hesitated, I could not
begin my false story until I realized I had
promised to go to the Hunt Club, I had
promised, the fact gave me strength, courage.
I smiled, and then I stretched and
yawned. It was an instinct, and yet not without
strategy; it suggested that I considered
going out to lunch a bore. I felt the lack of
enthusiasm, which lent my story credit.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said Mumsie after I had
told my fiction, “you are here to enjoy yourself,
I’m sure I’m glad to see you do so.”</p>

<p>Dear old Mumsie, how little she deserves
my treatment of her!</p>

<p>Before I dressed for the Hunt Club, I put
my things together so that the maids might
move them to the room I am to occupy during
Sister Mary’s stay.</p>

<p>As I walked into town the idea impressed
itself on me that there was no reason why I
should not have told Mumsie I was invited to
the Hunt Club by some friends—she goes
there herself.</p>

<p>Conscience again.</p>

<p>My first motor drive. The very first time I
rested in the deep and luxurious cushions and
was whirled away by hidden mechanism. Of
course it would not do to let my companions
know the truth, that this was a first experience,
and I think I succeeded fairly well. I’m
sure I succeeded. But I needed every bit of
my self-control.</p>

<p>How grand I felt sweeping over the frozen
snow, snuggled in furs; and how I admired
Charlie for his mastery of the mechanism: I
believe this appealed to me more than his
prowess as a hockeyist.</p>

<p>We went miles and miles and then turned
off the road and on through a grove of forest
trees until we brought up before a great
building. There were a number of other
motors standing about.</p>

<p>The club was beautifully warm and we
entered the lounge, as Iris explained, where
huge logs were burning in a fireplace. About
the place were small tables just like the Palm-room
of the King Henry-the-Eighth Hotel.
All was wonderfully neat and had the appearance
of being well kept. The air was stimulating
with the breath of the forest. I glanced
through a window and looked over a few fields
and a great stretch of water. How beautiful
I thought, how lovely it must be to take such
things as the Hunt Club as a matter of course.
Poor little me, how my soul yearns for the
money that is power.</p>

<p>There were card-players at several tables.
“Shall I have to play?” was my thought. Iris
carried me off to the cloak-room and I asked
her if we were to play.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied.</p>

<p>“Oh!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What is it, didn’t you expect to play?”</p>

<p>“It never struck me we should play, and I
don’t think I have enough money, if I should
lose—”</p>

<p>Iris laughed immoderately.</p>

<p>“You are a funny girl, really you are; why
let such a matter trouble you? Besides, you’ll
have Charlie Lien as partner. If you lose,
he’ll pay the bill.”</p>

<p>I know I blushed and looked confused.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” Iris continued, “Charlie
Lien’s taking you up is the funniest thing—”</p>

<p>“Why?” I demanded.</p>

<p>“Because you are so unlike Vivi Strange—”</p>

<p>“Vivi Strange?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know?” said Iris. “Why I
thought everybody knew!”</p>

<p>“No,” I had to say.</p>

<p>“Vivi Strange was Charlie’s old girl. Her
mother has taken her to the Mediterranean for
the benefit of her health,—so she says—that
is her mother. But those whose chief delight
it is to gossip say it was to get her away from
Charlie.”</p>

<p>I felt red and angry. A surge of jealousy
swept through me. So Charlie has or had
another girl.</p>

<p>We played cards, we drank, smoked, had
lunch, played cards, drank again, and smoked
more, and returned to the city. I asked to be
put down at Horace’s. I wished for a cup of
coffee, naturally I must pull myself together
before returning home.</p>

<p>I had tea all by myself in Horace’s. I’m
afraid my nerves are getting in a frightful
shape, however, I had a good tea, for Charlie
gave me our winnings, three dollars and sixty-five
cents. Thank goodness, Sister Mary
would be at home on my return and her
children. They would draw attention from
me.</p>

<p>As I walked home I kept revolving in my
mind “Vivi Strange was Charlie’s old girl.”
What a fool I am! But the realization that
I am a fool did not dissipate my jealousy. I
obtained some relief by occupying my mind
with the problem as to why Mrs. Strange had
taken her daughter away and of what she was
frightened. Who were the Stranges and would
not Charlie Lien be considered a good match?
And yet I knew that in entertaining this
question, I was deceiving myself. I realized
I could only so deceive myself, because I
wished to do so.</p>

<p>“ ’Ook, ’ook Uncle Dack, ’orses,” I heard
a child’s voice exclaim as I passed along the
upper hall to my new retreat, the small room
adjoining my former room and used by Mumsie
as a sewing and lumber-room.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are very fine horses,” replied
the voice of Mr. Bang. The child was evidently
Miss Jessie.</p>

<p>“ ’Ook, ’ook, Uncle Dack, why does one
’orse put out his hoot before the other ’orse
puts his hoot out?”</p>

<p>“That’s because the horses are not keeping
step, Jessie. What makes you ask so many
questions?”</p>

<p>Jessie evidently ignored both the question
and the implied admonition, for she continued:</p>

<p>“ ’Ook, ’ook, Uncle Dack, the moon has its
hace all boken.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t the moon get its hace
mended?”</p>

<p>“Because the moon is naughty and is too
careless.”</p>

<p>I took off my things and as the door was
open, entered the room, Mr. Bang was at the
window amusing himself with Lawrence. Mr.
Bang turned at my entrance and with the
shade of a smile on his face introduced Jessie
to me. The little girl was very bashful and
placed her arms over her eyes and remained
quiet. Her Uncle urged her to shake hands
with the kind lady, but without result, until
she raced towards me and threw her arms
around my neck and gave me a great hug.</p>

<p>“Where’s Mother?” I asked.</p>

<p>As Jessie did not answer, Mr. Bang informed
me his sister had gone with Mumsie
on some errand, and that Jean, the nurse, was
in the kitchen preparing the nursery supper.</p>

<p>Then I heard Uncle in the hall and soon he
came cheerily in, caught the children up and
kissed them, beaming with pleasure. I could
not but feel sorry for him as an old thought
came back to me that Providence had been
unkind in not giving him a family. What a
different atmosphere this was to the one I had
recently been in, the Hunt Club! What a pain
it would be to Uncle had he a daughter, and
found her out in deceit such as mine. My
conscience was at me again, and my head
ached.</p>

<p>I was really prepared for something very
awful in Sister Mary, and the fact that Jessie
and Lawrence were such fine youngsters had
not affected my estimate. Picture my surprise,
when I found her a very pretty woman
with most engaging manners. She enquired
after my health and said she hoped I was
enjoying my stay in town so prettily, that she
quite won my heart and made me dislike her
brute of a brother still more. I cannot understand
how Uncle and Mumsie allowed him to
speak so ill-naturedly of her. “If Sister Mary
had as good an opinion of other people as she
has of herself, she would be a high-class
citizen,” is his latest comment.</p>

<p>At dinner Mumsie gossiped with Sister
Mary, and Uncle and Mr. Bang chatted on
politics and business. I understand Uncle is
financially interested in his nephew’s enterprises.
I was left pretty much to my own
thought, which, needless to say, dwelt upon
Charlie Lien and my other new friends. When
conversation flagged I amused myself watching
the expressions of Sister Mary and her
brother. Whenever the latter made a remark
to Auntie, apprehension marked the features
of his sister. She appeared to have seated
herself on the proverbial keg of powder. And
he—Mr. Bang—appeared also to be on edge,
and even more taciturn and cynical than ever.</p>

<p>“Why did they give the Henry-the-Eighth
Hotel its name?” I asked Uncle.</p>

<p>All eyes at once were turned on me. Mr.
Bang’s glance being even contemptuous if not
surly, I thought.</p>

<p>“Because that jolly monarch’s name suggests
magnificence and extravagance. You
have read of the ‘Field of the Cloth of
Gold?’ ”</p>

<p>I assented to the soft impeachment.</p>

<p>“Merry King Hal’s name also suggests a
plenitude of wives, an over-indulgence in
womankind, ha!” he went on.</p>

<p>Sister Mary’s large eyes were wide open
now, and I fancied I could almost see in them
an expression of fear, as well as pain. Evidently
she did not know what to expect next,
and, I fancy if this guess of mine is right,
shared the apprehensions of the rest of us.</p>

<p>“Oh, oh, Jack,” gasped his sister.</p>

<p>“All right, Mary. Don’t be frightened; but
this place is largely what the French call a
‘House of Pleasure’ and it’s just as well Little
Partner should be warned.”</p>

<p>If the French mean anything dreadful by
“House of Pleasure,” the words conveyed
nothing more to me than what I had found it,
a place frequented by men and women, many
of them vulgar, who drank cocktails and
smoked cigarettes. But why should I be
warned?</p>

<p>“I’m sure I’ve had dinner there often,”
spoke up Mumsie, “and I know many good
people who frequently go there for tea.” That
was comforting anyhow.</p>

<p>“Yes,” drawled Mr. Bang, “ostensibly it’s
an hotel.”</p>

<p>Then Uncle hit me a blow when he said,
“But Belle, you would not care to hear that
Elsie had been seen in the Palm-room there,
would you?” I am quite sure that Uncle did
not know the truth; though his nephew may
have. But oh! the pain it gave me, the agony
of doubt and apprehension!</p>

<p>“Not exactly,” said Mumsie.</p>

<p>“The hotel was built to fill a long felt want,”
said Uncle.</p>

<p>“And thereby hangs a tale,” retorted the
nephew. “According to Timkins,—(the
blessed Timkins)—when the idea of building
the hotel came up, the Jinricky family led the
patriotic enterprise. They invited aid from
the public-spirited, and opened a stock list.
The hotel was built and then the owning company
leased it to an operating company—which
was the Jinrickeys—with the result that
the stock of the original company is worthless,
while the stock of the new company is profitable.”</p>

<p>“It was a palpable fraud,” murmured
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“But unfortunately, a fraud the law can’t
punish,” commented Uncle.</p>

<p>“It simply shows what people owning millions
will do. There’s no measure to human
avarice. Personally, I refuse to have anything
to do with people who derive revenue
from whiskey, either directly or through
stock-holdings. I have worked with a pick and
shovel, rather than make money by selling
whiskey. Selling whiskey is absolutely beyond
the pale, and I claim the right to despise all
those connected with it, down half a dozen
generations.”</p>

<p>At the end of this speech Sister Mary began
to smile, finding relief no doubt in the idea
that her brother had spent his store of fury.
I believe his ill-nature accumulates till it
gushes like a geyser, or erupts like a volcano,
which having gushed or erupted feels at ease.
I rather believe he is incensed with me. I am
sure he knows I have been to the Henry-the-Eighth.
But I do not care, who is he?</p>

<p>In honour of Sister Mary we invaded
Uncle’s den and talked, at least Mumsie and
Sister Mary and Uncle talked. Mr. Bang and
I listened. Perhaps only I was listening, for
I do not think Mr. Bang paid the least attention
to the conversation. He seemed lost in
his own thoughts. I can see the antagonism
existing between that brother and sister. To
Mary, Jack is still the <span class='it'>enfant terrible</span>. In her
presence he becomes even more irascible, and
bridles up as if anticipating a reproof from
her for anything he may say. She seems
always prepared to disagree with him, and,
at this, one perhaps may not wonder.</p>

<p>Uncle went into raptures over Jessie and
Lawrence—Jessie is so bright, so original, so
active, and vivacious; and Lawrence has the
makings of a fine boy. I won’t try to describe
either mother or children, for I do not consider
I shall ever be clever enough to write of
children, and I am quite sure Sister Mary is
too deep for me to fathom.</p>

<p>When I might I slipped off to my own room—to
think. The shock Uncle gave me at dinner
still hurt, and I am beginning to think
the game is not worth the candle. I believe
in my efforts to get into society, I have merely
got switched into the fast set, and this is more
than I bargained for. How my head aches—and
my nerves are all on edge. Cocktails and
cigarettes!</p>

<p>No further engagement was made with me
by Charlie. I think I shall leave the future to
him. If he wishes to see me again, he can
ring me up or write. Since I arrived in town
I have sought pleasure assiduously and found—sensations.
I dwell in fear continuously—fear
that I shall be discovered in my duplicity.
Life is a nightmare—and yet I go on! No
doubt my remorse is due to reaction after this
afternoon’s festivities. If only Mr. Bang
were as nice as I believe him to be good! Why
are good people so uninteresting, and in some
cases so—positively repugnant?</p>

<p>Nothing on the tapis for to-morrow but
writing this wretched diary and—possibly a
shopping expedition.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 5th.</span></span></p>

<p>Someone has said: “You can never tell from
the way the wind blows how the baby will look
in the photograph.” Mumsie, Sister Mary
and I walked demurely into town escorted by
Mr. Bang. Could anything be less promising?</p>

<p>Nothing would do our cavalier but that we
must enjoy his hospitality at the Green Tree
Restaurant for lunch. “They have a decent
orchestra and the grub is not half bad,” he
pleaded.</p>

<p>We entered a confectionery shop and passed
up a handsome stairway to the first floor,
where we were met by a head waiter, and
shown to a table from which, through the large
window, we commanded a view of the street.
As we approached our table, I recognized at
the next one Mrs. Mount and her daughter,
and at a table over against the wall Iris Carey
and Basil Locke. I kept my eyes away from
these last and prepared my best smile for Mrs.
Mount, and with Mumsie bowed my acknowledgments.
I took a seat that would place
my back to Iris and her swain.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang pressed me to supplement my
modest order with several dainties and we
settled down to await the arrival of a generous
lunch. I felt the place very hot, though the
air was not close.</p>

<p>Mumsie set her eyes on the young creatures
and said to Sister Mary, “There’s the Carey
girl having lunch with Basil Locke, and
drinking wine too—the brats.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it awful, and so young?” agreed
Sister Mary.</p>

<p>“They belong to the fastest of the fast—such
a pity! The Careys are such a good old
family———”</p>

<p>“And the boy is doing his best to add his
people to the ranks of the genteel poor,” added
Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Too bad!” muttered Sister Mary.</p>

<p>“How’s that?” I asked, feeling I might
safely appear curious. “Why poor?”</p>

<p>“He’s supposed to be a mining broker.
What of his father’s money he can’t lose trying
to rig the market, he loses playing poker,”
explained Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Yesterday I won some of his money, but
our game was only bridge, eminently more
respectable than poker.</p>

<p>The Mounts were the first to rise. Condescendingly
her ladyship approached our
table. Mr. Bang rose deferentially; his manners
are certainly excellent. Sister Mary was
introduced.</p>

<p>“And how are the dear people in Ottawa,
Lady Lawson, Lady Matthews, and dear Sir
Charles? Do you know, really, I think Sir
Charles Matthews is the most <span class='it'>delightful</span> man;
really charming manners—so rare now-a-days.
Lady Matthews—Clair I always call
her—has asked me down for the Opening of
Parliament, and, do you know, really, Doris
has <span class='it'>never</span> attended a Drawing-room yet! You
know we go to Europe so often, or to Bermuda,
for the winter.”</p>

<p>“Are you not leaving on the 15th by the
<span class='it'>Carmania</span> from New York?” asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“No, do you know, really, it is the March
winds I feel the most, if <span class='it'>only</span> I can get away
for March, and you know I always do,” she
put in parenthetically with a glance at Sister
Mary and me; and then continued, accompanying
her words, by nodding her head, and
advancing her chin in her own peculiar way.
“I think I shall this year take Doris to the
Drawing-room, and then to St. Agathe or
Algonquin Park for winter sport. And then
you know Clair—that is Lady Matthews—is
so pressing in her invitation—Why!”</p>

<p>For some moments before Mrs. Mount broke
off her conversation I noticed Mr. Bang’s eyes
directed towards Iris and Basil. A slight
rustle behind me and Mr. Bang jumping to
his feet, caused the interruption. Mr. Bang
made a bolt towards where his eyes had been
directed, and I wheeled round and saw him
bending over the form of Iris, while beside
him stood Basil, looking on more or less
stupidly. Of course, we all rushed to help.
Mr. Bang grabbed a tumbler of water and
threw it in the face of the unconscious girl.
The waiters came crowding round, and some
of the other guests.</p>

<p>“I think we had better take her to one of
the Reception-rooms,” said Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“What—Oh, what—is the matter, with
her?” cried Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>“She’s fainted,” answered Mr. Bang,
“Don’t you think I had better take her into
the Reception-room?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, no, let her come out of it,” protested
Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>“But it may be a long time before she
does,” Mr. Bang objected.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we had,” agreed Basil at last.</p>

<p>So without more ceremony Mr. Bang gathered
her in his arms, and, followed by Basil,
made his way through a portico into what I
believe was a Reception-room.</p>

<p>“Oh my! Oh my! poor Mrs. Carey! What
will she say, how can she bear it? And Iris
has been talked about quite a lot, too. Do you
know really, if it had been Doris here———”</p>

<p>“But Mrs. Mount,” protested Mumsie,
“Iris Carey became overcome by the heat and
fainted.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount looked steadily out of the window,
advanced her chin, drew up her mouth
into the grimmest of grim expressions, and
said slowly and deliberately, “Yes, Iris Carey
fainted,” and then under her voice, in the
thinnest of tones, “and Mr. Bang is a fool.”</p>

<p>Mumsie, Sister Mary and myself moved
sadly back to our table. Mrs. Mount said
good-afternoon, and rustled away.</p>

<p>Naturally the incident was a shock and
particularly to me. I have not yet got over
the fright Uncle gave me by his remark about
the Henry-the-Eighth Palm-room. Now I
have this added stress. But I have this consolation,
Mumsie does not know that I know
Iris.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang came back to his place.</p>

<p>“What ailed the girl?” asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“A combination of things, I fancy.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“Wine, heat, and possibly, chiefly, a cigarette
in which there was a little too much
opium.”</p>

<p>“Poor girl,” muttered Sister Mary.</p>

<p>“I smelled her breath,” added Mr. Bang,
“and it was strong with alcohol.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid Mrs. Mount suspects,” said
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Sort of trained knowledge, as it were.
Yes, I suppose a tavern-keeper’s daughter
ought to be able to distinguish between a case
of acute intoxication and a fainting fit.” His
voice was sarcastic.</p>

<p>With that our luncheon came to an end.</p>

<p>I felt relieved when the discussion of the
affair at lunch, which as I knew, would prove
a topic at dinner, was ended. I made a remark
about the <span class='it'>Vicar of Wakefield</span>.</p>

<p>I was still curious to know why Mr. Bang
had given the copy of it to me. What was the
idea behind the offering?</p>

<p>“Have you read the copy Jack gave you?”
Uncle asked.</p>

<p>“Only a little here and there to see how
much of the story comes back to me.”</p>

<p>“I always think the <span class='it'>Vicar of Wakefield</span>
such a delightful story,” and Sister Mary
smiled sweetly upon me.</p>

<p>“That is true,” said Uncle, “but the feature
of the tale is that the social ‘bug’ seems to
have been active in Goldsmith’s time too, and
perhaps was then just as prevalent as it is
to-day. Don’t you think, Elsie, you can find
a suspicion of very fine satire here and
there?”</p>

<p>“Really, Uncle, I read the story so long ago,
I have quite forgotten the impression it made
on me. I was so young and now I have only
glanced through it and read the story told by
George, the vicar’s son.”</p>

<p>“That is a page out of Goldsmith’s own
life.”</p>

<p>“Poor Poet Noll!” said Mumsie. “Except
Charles Lamb, wasn’t he the dearest?”</p>

<p>“Because he ‘wrote like an angel,’ ” suggested
Uncle.</p>

<p>“Goldsmith was a loveable, weak character
with whom starchy, business-like people often
lost patience. He was anyhow better than his
judges.”</p>

<p>“His heart was too soft,” suggested Sister
Mary.</p>

<p>“And he had vanities,” said Uncle, “but he
was of the salt of the earth. A born Irishman!
When he died old Samuel Johnson wept, and
Joshua Reynolds said he could do no more
work that day. These are testimonies to
worth. I have always suspected Bozzy of
being jealous of Goldy.”</p>

<p>“What I meant,” said Mr. Bang, whose
strong point is evidently not literature, “was
that Goldsmith was one of the kind who are
easily misunderstood.”</p>

<p>“So are we all,” cried Uncle. “Your aunt
invariably misunderstands me.”</p>

<p>“Oh pooh!” said Mumsie.</p>

<p>“And I think his contemporary Dr. Johnson
a most interesting character,” smiled
Mary in her drawing-room manner.</p>

<p>“At any rate he knew the Yankee,” put in
Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>I looked at Uncle and smiled. Uncle
smiled too, then drew his face into a fearful
frown and bringing his clenched fist down on
the table thundered—in what must have been
meant for the Johnsonian manner—“Sir!
they are a race of convicts.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it,” cried Jack and burst out
laughing. So did I.</p>

<p>“What’s the joke?” demanded Sister
Mary.</p>

<p>Poor Mr. Bang! I’m quite sure he gave me
the <span class='it'>Vicar of Wakefield</span> because he thought it
might do me good. How kind of him! Pooh!
as Auntie says.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 6th.</span></span></p>

<p>What luck I am in! We are going to
Ottawa, Uncle and Mumsie, their nephew and
myself. I am going to attend the Drawing-room.
Hoo, hoo!</p>

<p>I had the blues all day before I knew. Perhaps
it was because I worked so hard at this
diary this morning. In the afternoon—to get
rid of cobwebs—I walked out by myself.
Indeed, I had the blues. I realized I had lost
the grip on life that was mine by inheritance,
and I saw no other in prospect. I feel I am a
social derelict.</p>

<p>On my return home I came softly up the
stairs and entered my room. Mr. Bang was
with the children and I left the door ajar that
I might hear them.</p>

<p>“Tell me a story, Uncle Dack,” Jessie
demanded.</p>

<p>“Red Ridinghood?”</p>

<p>“No, No, another story, a new story, a great
big story, that has not got an end.”</p>

<p>“All stories come to an end sometime Jessie;
but I will try and tell you a long story.”</p>

<p>“Once upon a time a beautiful, young lady
set out upon a highway. The highway was
called Life, and beside it grew the flowers of
Friendship and Truth. It ran through a
valley and as she journeyed along she beheld
all things about her were very beautiful. The
fields, the woods, the meadows, all lay in contentment
and joy. Shadows came, but they
quickly passed and the world seemed more
beautiful than if they had never been. The
people she saw travelling on the highway were
many and different. Some had beautiful
dresses, such as she wore; others were shabby.
Some carried heavy loads, but all were happy.
Some were beautiful, some ugly, and some
were neither good-looking nor plain. Do you
understand me, kiddie?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the child gravely. Anyhow, I
understood.</p>

<p>“And the beautiful young lady was happy,
and sang gaily as she walked along. But soon
she came to where the road ran beside a great
mountain, and here she was met by a grand
lady. This lady was very, very grand; she
wore tinsel, and spangles, and diamonds, and
rubies, and saphires, and emeralds, and
pearls, and her name was Ambition. And
Ambition smiled sweetly upon the young lady,
and said ‘I am your friend, come with me.’
And the young lady said, ‘Where to?’ and
Ambition said, ‘Away up on this mountain,
which is called Society.’ ‘But,’ said the
beautiful, young lady, ‘I am happy, why
should I toil?’ To this Ambition made reply,
‘Because if you climb this mountain with me
you will be able to look down upon the rest
of the world.’ ”</p>

<p>“What is a mountain, Uncle Dack? Tell
me,” interrupted Jessie.</p>

<p>“A mountain, Jessie, is a great high hill, a
hundred times higher than this house. ‘Will
I be happier because I look down upon other
people?’ asked the beautiful, young lady.
‘Oh! very much,’ replied Ambition, and with
this she took the young lady’s hand and led
her up the hill.”</p>

<p>“Did Ambition have a big, long nose, and
long ears, and great, big, shining teeth?”
demanded Jessie.</p>

<p>“No, Jessie, Ambition is naturally pleasing.
So they started off, Ambition and the
beautiful young lady. As they left the highway
and stepped on the rising ground, they
found people sitting about in groups and all
were very merry and gay. Through these
Ambition led the beautiful, young lady until
the ground began to rise more and more, and
here Ambition said to her: ‘Behold the world,
does it not appear more beautiful, now that
you may look down upon it?’ And the beautiful,
young lady looked upon the Highway of
Life, and the world did appear more beautiful
than when she was on the beaten way. She
did not, however, see the smiling, happy faces,
nor hear the gay laughter of the people. But
the laughter of those who also had left the
Highway of Life sounded in her ears, and
appeared much more merry, and their smiles
were much broader.</p>

<p>“Ambition then cried, ‘On, on,’ and drew
the young lady up the steep side of the mountain.
And the dear girl noticed that the flowers
of Friendship and Truth were much
tramped upon and pulled up by the roots,
and she spoke in wonder at it. And Ambition
said, ‘Oh, those are only flowers. They who
have gone before have used them to pull themselves
up by.’ But the beautiful, young lady
said to herself that she would not so treat the
flowers of Friendship and Truth; but Ambition
urged her on and on, and soon she found
that she, too, was destroying the flowers of
Friendship and Truth. And whenever she
would speak Ambition would say, ‘On, on,
hurry, hurry!’ and so the beautiful, young
lady did not know what she did. And the
beautiful, young lady noticed that the higher
she climbed, the fewer were the flowers of
Friendship and Truth, and the higher she
climbed the more were the flowers of Friendship
and Truth uprooted and torn, and the
more wearied looked the faces of those she
met.</p>

<p>“But Ambition still called ‘On, on,’ and the
beautiful, young lady climbed up and up till
there were no more flowers of Friendship and
Truth, and those who sat about were old and
wizened, and ugly. Up and up, and up, the
young lady climbed, leaving all others behind
until she stood on the very top of the mountain
called Society. Here she looked down
upon the beautiful world; but she was so far
above it, that she could not see the green fields,
or the gay meadows, or the woods, the flowers,
or anything; and she sighed and turned
towards Ambition, but Ambition had fled;
Ambition was nowhere to be seen. And the
wind that blew against her was chill and cold,
and the beautiful, young lady felt very, very
sad.”</p>

<p>I don’t know if I may be called a beautiful,
young lady, but I believe that Mr. Bang was
telling this tale for my ears. He must be
troubling his head a great deal about me. He
has not shown me much attention lately, but I
know I am continually in his mind. I’m sure
I could never support being called “Mrs.
Bang.”</p>

<p>At dinner Uncle announced that he had to
go to Ottawa on the ninth; and then Mr. Bang
electrified us all by inviting Mumsie and me
to go too as his guests, for the opening of Parliament
on the thirteenth, and the Drawing-room
on the evening of the following Saturday.
He had made two hundred and fifty
dollars he said, in a little speculation for the
decline in Poverty, Distress and Want Railway
Stock, and he would enjoy “blowing it
in.” Such an expression!</p>

<p>“Just for a few days at the ‘Boardin’<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a>
House’ ” I thought it very strange that Mr.
Bang, with his general broadness, had decided
to take us to a Boarding House. If he wished
to spend two hundred and fifty dollars in a
few days, I should think a hotel was the proper
place.</p>

<p>I have never been to Ottawa, so I asked
Uncle what the city was like.</p>

<p>“Ottawa is a very pretty place, and its
winter climate good—if you ask about the
city as a city. If you ask about it socially
———”</p>

<p>“It is best described as the re-incarnation
of the home of the original snob,” broke in
Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>What else was said, I shall not here set
down. I think it will be much better to set
down my own ideas of Ottawa.</p>

<p>And then the conversation drifted to comparisons
of the men of these and other days.
Uncle was of the opinion that the general code
of honour was higher now than it was at the
beginning of the nineteenth century. Mr.
Bang agreed with this but stated it was unwise
to lean too heavily upon any man’s sense
of honour.</p>

<p>“I once sued a descendant of an Irish king
for one hundred dollars. I thought the fellow
could not evade the facts, but when he got
into the stand he lied a hole through a stone-wall.
If you wish a sample of a high-class
liar, get a weak creature on the wrong side
of a law-suit and then watch him wiggle. My
friend was of people who fancy themselves
of superior clay, and yet he lied—lied confusedly—to
beat one, who had befriended him,
out of one hundred dollars. Imagine a man
being admonished by a judge to remember he
was on his oath! Is such humiliation worth
the privilege of cheating a friend out of one
hundred dollars?”</p>

<p>My mind keeps playing upon Charlie Lien.
I did not meet him to-day. It is so humiliating
to think he does not seem to care. As I
passed the Henry-the-Eighth to-day, I felt I
would like a glass of wine and a cigarette, my
nerves seem to demand them.</p>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f3'><a href='#r3'>[3]</a></span>

Possibly Elsie might have spelt this word differently.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 7th.</span></span></p>

<p>I have seen Charlie Lien. I have had lunch
with him. I am the most wretched of girls—women.
I am a woman. I have developed
in the last ten days.</p>

<p>But did a more inconsistent girl, woman or
child ever live? I am consistent only in my
inconsistency. Battledore-shuttlecock. Hither
and thither I am bounced like a weak, feathery
thing. One impulse throws me against my
conscience, and then I rebound. And then
another whim, inclination, impulse, instinct,
or what-not, sends me off again. Happiness
can be found only in contentment! I am far
from contented, I am far from happy.</p>

<p>After all what does it matter? One dissolute
person more or less in the world cannot
matter, and dear, old Dad will not live long,
and Uncle and Mumsie will not feel more than
sorry—very sorry. Eternity is so very hard
to conceive of, forever and ever and ever. I
have felt remorse, just enough to understand
or feel how its quintessence might well be hell.
And yet, there are so many worse than Elsie
Travers. May I not suffer as bravely as they?</p>

<p>This morning’s mail brought a letter from
Charlie, so I lied to Mumsie and came away,—same
story, an invitation from Hannah
Smart. With Charlie I was happy, or shall
I say excited. But as I walked home, reaction
set in. Charlie Lien is an evil influence,
against which my inherent sense of rightness
revolts. Calm analysis tells me that social
ambition is passing from me. What is supplanting
it? I do not know. But I know
what it is to which I cling—the real and
tangible pride of ancestry—which Uncle and
Mr. Bang say is loyalty. Surely ancestor-worship
is a comprehensive virtue—better
than social-climbing. It is the rock to which
I hold, the rock to which I shall continue to
cling.</p>

<p>I told Charlie we were going to Ottawa. He
told me his mother was taking Mabel to Norway
House on Norway Lake for three weeks.
At this information I felt relieved.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 8th.</span></span></p>

<p>Packing and shopping was the order of to-day.
Of course, Sister Mary is returning
with us and dear little Jessie and Lawrence,
and Jean. Dear old Uncle, I know, will revel
in Jessie; and the number of questions Jessie
will ask in the hours of our journey!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 9th.</span></span></p>

<p>The station at Ottawa is quite the grandest
I have ever seen and on entering it I was so
lost in wonderment, so overcome by its
immensity, that I followed my seniors without
any questionings. We entered a tunnel and
walked up an incline which seemed interminable.
En route, Mr. Bang remarked: “This
passage-way always reminds me of the tunnel
that leads to the tomb of Seti in the ‘Valley
of the Dead’,” I suppose he was referring to
some distant parts.</p>

<p>Soon we came into a room flooded with
electric light and then passed into an elevator
and so up one floor, where we stepped out into
what struck me, as being of necessity a great
hotel. Uncle and Mr. Bang passed to the
counter, and registered. I could restrain
myself no longer, so I whispered a question to
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“That was only Jack’s joke: this is one of
the really good hotels of Canada.”</p>

<p>I looked about and saw ceilings immensely
high and passage-ways that led—anywhere. I
felt really happy.</p>

<p>Porters struggled with our hand-luggage
and a bell-boy holding keys in his hand passed
into the elevator and so we went to our rooms.
I entered mine and in a moment was alone. I
opened one door and looked into a clothes-closet.
I opened another and saw a bath. And
then I pulled up the blind and looked out. To
my left lights flashed far below, to the right
impenetrable space, in front of me were great
spectral masses—an inspiration—the Houses
of Parliament! I felt sorry I had been so
unkind in my thoughts of Mr. Bang. I was
indebted to him for all this grandeur.</p>

<p>My trunk was brought into the room. Would
I dress? Certainly. I felt satisfaction in my
worldly wisdom when Mumsie called for me
and I found her in full dress and Uncle and
Mr. Bang in their dinner-jackets.</p>

<p>I know my putting down these trivialities
would appear childish to anyone who read
them; but this is actually the first hotel in
which I have ever been a guest.</p>

<p>I felt small in the great dining-room, and
overawed by the tall waiter who led us to our
table. What a blessing it is that thoughts are
not visible! I was given a bill of fare and
immediately lost myself in a world of words
and figures. I was asked what I would have,
but the cost of everything seemed so great I
felt positively too frightened to choose. Dear
old Mumsie saw my embarrassment, and
ordered for me; then my nervousness left me.</p>

<p>Uncle and Mr. Bang pointed out different
politicians in the dining-room, whom they
recognized; but I am really not interested in
politicians.</p>

<p>Being Sunday there was nothing for us to
do, so we sat long at dinner discussing politics
and politicians. Mr. Bang hates the Liberals,
or “Grits,” as he invariably calls them most
cordially. Would the Government again
introduce the Navy Bill?</p>

<p>“The Grit opposition to the Navy Bill is
politics, merely dirty politics. They claim to
advance the scheme for a Canadian Navy, but
had the Government advanced their scheme
they would have opposed it, they would have
had some other,” he said.</p>

<p>“Is it not the duty of an Opposition to act
such a part as a process of sounding the
popular will?” queried Uncle.</p>

<p>“In some cases, yes: but not in this. The
Government did the most practical thing:
Ministers went to England and consulted the
Admiralty. The British Government told
them what they deemed expedient, suggested
three Dreadnoughts, told them of an emergency
and gave them the benefit of their secret
service. What could be more practical? The
Grits carried their opposition too far.”</p>

<p>“The Senate did the deed.”</p>

<p>“Subservient to the Grit caucus the Senate
did the deed,” agreed Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“You really believe there is an emergency,”
asked Mumsie, “that there is need for these
ships?”</p>

<p>“I do. What is more evident than that the
British Government is taxing the Mother
Country to death to meet an emergency, real
or fancied, and it is the duty of Canada to
bear a part. Isn’t it an Empire concern? But
the Grits think that Canada, forgetful of all
else but money-making, is willing to play the
stability and existence of the Empire against
a stake of thirty-five million dollars. The
populace has an open ear for pleasing assurance.
So they figure chances, but life and
liberty are not given us to be gambled with.
There are some things we may not gamble
with—and one of them—” he went on, “is a
maiden’s reputation.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang’s remark surprised Mumsie and
frightened me. I wish I could sound the
depths of that young man’s mind. True he
did not glance at me. Had he done so, it could
only have meant a warning, that he had knowledge
of my—intrigue. And here I feel the
pain of my folly, my duplicity. Oh, what a
fool was I! Social-climbing—the folly of it!</p>

<p>“You don’t accuse the Grits of being disloyal,
do you?” asked Mumsie.</p>

<p>“The Grits have no political affiliations outside
Canada and are not disloyal. Given an
occasional opportunity to misgovern<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> the
country, they are happy enough. They look
upon the Yankee as a success, that is the
Scotch Grits do——”</p>

<p>“How about the French?” queried Uncle.</p>

<p>“The Canadian Frenchman does not like
the Yankee and is not a money-seeker. He,
like the Scotch Grit, has no outside affiliation.
He has no love for British institutions. How
could it be expected of him? He is not actively
disloyal: he does not lie awake at night worrying
about the vitality of the British Empire.
Being, perforce, a guest of the Empire, he has
decided to enjoy its privileges and dodge its
obligations.”</p>

<p>“That would seem reasonable enough,”
suggested Uncle. “Put ourselves in his
place.”</p>

<p>“I was in Ville Marie, a French village,
that remains in its primeval state. About it
I saw floating a dozen French flags, but no
British. Of what was this the expression?
Not of loyalty to Britain. But it was not
necessarily the token of love of France. In
fact your French-Canadian hates the old country
Frenchman. Laurier—” Mr. Bang stopped
with the one word and beckoned a man
passing from his dinner. The gentleman came
towards us, was introduced and invited to
join our party. He was Mr. Fraser, a Western
Member.</p>

<p>“You are a personal friend of your chief:
what is his outstanding characteristic?”
asked Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Serenity,” came the quick response.</p>

<p>“We were discussing politics,” explained
Mr. Bang, “and I am conscious I am prejudiced.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser chatted a few moments and then
excused himself.</p>

<p>“A most apt description,” said Uncle. “I
don’t know any better.”</p>

<p>“Fraser is a clever fellow, the wonder is he
remains a Grit,” agreed Mr. Bang. “Serenity—the
serenity of his mind; that’s it. Polished
to reflect the philosophy of others. A man of
learning, but of no understanding: that’s
Laurier.”</p>

<p>“No understanding! how could a man have
been the Premier of Canada without understanding?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“By the serenity of his mind. Cleverness
is a native attribute. In homely circles it is
called common-sense. A serene mind is the
complement of a healthy body and the polish
of learning. A man may be learned and yet
not clever, or he may be clever and yet not
learned. Herein is the world deceived.”</p>

<p>“What do you call a clever man?” asked
Mumsie, smiling.</p>

<p>“That needs some definition too. A clever
man is a man of understanding, one who has
his mind in tune with the scheme of the universe;
a man who can feel the influences at
play about him and foresee to some extent the
play of events. Clever men are rare: and are
seldom attractive. They work their minds so
assiduously that they have no time for the
commonplace. In a general way as man’s best
study is man, so the clever man is he who has
the clearest understanding of human nature.
Laurier has no understanding of human
nature.”</p>

<p>“And Borden, what of him?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Borden’s outstanding impulse is affection
for the British Empire. As Laurier is a
French-Canadian, so is Borden a British
Loyalist. At the present time this is the most
valuable attribute in the Premier of Canada.
French Canada is hunting for an impulse,
and so its tide of life is dormant. Loyalist
Canada is responding to its inherent virility,
reaching out. Borden is doing his best to
train its growth. Beyond his loyalty Borden
is a kindly gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Is he not clever?” I enquired.</p>

<p>“You are probably labouring under the
mistaken idea that a Prime Minister is a
Napoleon. You don’t trouble to realize that
the Prime Minister is selected by his associates.
With the Grits the custom is to choose
a man of upright character and turn the limelight
on him, so that they may practise their
rascalities in his shadow. In this process the
stronger the light the greater their immunity.”
Mr. Bang did not answer my question
and I did not repeat it. But his systematic
and patronizing abuse of the Grits amused me.</p>

<p>“You know, Elsie,” remarked Mumsie,
“these two have decided that the whole parliamentary
system is wrong.”</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” I exclaimed inwardly, “they
must be out of their minds.”</p>

<p>“Not the parliamentary system,” corrected
Uncle, “but the processes of electing members———”</p>

<p>“We won’t inflict our arguments and ideas
upon you,” cut in Mr. Bang, with what was
intended to be a pleasant smile. “But the
public is such a poor judge of character, we
are all of us so easily caught by the pleasing
ways which cover either weakness or villainy,
that it would be better were the selection of
representatives taken from us and left to the
goddess of Fortune.”</p>

<p>I looked puzzled while Mumsie smiled.
Uncle explained: “The idea is that our judges
select, say, twenty candidates in each riding,
to represent all classes, and from these twenty
one is selected by lot and sent to Parliament
whether he would or not. The larger questions
of the day should be settled by direct
vote, by plebiscite, so that the popular will
could find direct expression.”</p>

<p>I did not feel interested but pretended that
I did. Mr. Bang tried further to enlighten
me.</p>

<p>“In England at the last election, if a man
wished to support Home Rule he would vote
for the Government, or, if he desired to support
Free Trade he would do the same, but
there was no process by which he could support
the one and oppose the other, whereas, if
he had a ballot—or referendum—on which
these definite, different principles were set
down, a clear expression of the national wish
could be given. That is impossible under the
present system.”</p>

<p>“I thought you did not value public opinion,”
I said. I thought I had caught him
there.</p>

<p>“The public mind is suspicious, shallow,
vacillating and generally contemptible. In
other words the public is a cad and not too
honest. So much for my opinion of the public.
But the point I would make is that Parliament
does not necessarily express the public
mind. The party system has robbed Parliament
of its full capacity, and as an institution
I’m inclined to think it will pass away.”</p>

<p>“Jack is looking some far distance into the
future,” said Uncle.</p>

<p>“The growth of ages as the system of Parliament
is does not die in a night,” said Mr.
Bang. “But I daresay there are some people,
mostly Grits, who are fond of saying, ‘Vox
populi, vox Dei’; whereas really, the voice
of the people is the braying of an ass. The
homely idea is that the ordinary mother is
fitted by nature with an instinct, which directs
her properly to look after her infant, whereas,
as any doctor will tell you, the human mother
is naturally extraordinarily incapable.”</p>

<p>The mother and her child! on what subject
has this strange man not an idea?</p>

<p>On the whole, as at the end of the great day
I snuggled into bed, I felt pleased with the
way the world was treating me, and looked
forward with pleasurable anticipation to the
morrow.</p>

<div class='footnote'>
<p class='footnote'>
<span class='footnote-id' id='f4'><a href='#r4'>[4]</a></span>

Doubtless Mr. Bang would not have said this had he
known the rottenness existing in Manitoba.</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 10th.</span></span></p>

<p>Owing to the fog I could see only the spires
of the House of Parliament, and the different
blocks when I looked out of my window this
morning. But then, after we had breakfast,
and left the Boardin’ House and walked up
Parliament Hill, I saw them shining in the
bright frosty air, in the winter sunlight and
through the fading mist; they seemed to
express the character of a young and healthy
nation. As we walked past them and came to
Nepean Point, and looked over the river and
the hills of Quebec, wrapped in forest, some
dreams of Empire came into my mind. Here
I was at the heart of a nation; what was to be
its development? A hundred years hence, for
instance, what rank would Canada take among
the nations? Would I could think our future
was as bright as the physical prospect before
us! All seemed so beautiful, so clean, so
strong, so perfect! For the first time in my
life I felt my personal responsibility, that I
had a duty to this, my country.</p>

<p>We gazed upon the prospect for many minutes,
Mr. Bang and Uncle pointing out the
Chaudiere, the location of Rideau Hall, and
other objects of interest. As we turned away
Mr. Bang with a sigh exclaimed, “What a
pity our people are so dishonest in their politics!”
Doubtless his mind was filled with
thoughts similar to mine.</p>

<p>Uncle took leave of us, saying he must
attend to business; so we were left with Mr.
Bang as our sole guide. We visited the House
of Commons, the Senate Chamber, and the
Library. In some way the things I saw did
not match my expectations. Of course I was
much interested in the Senate Chamber, for
here I understood His Excellency would open
Parliament on Thursday at three; and here
would I make my bow on Saturday evening.</p>

<p>Sight-seeing is tiresome work, and I was
glad when lunch-time came.</p>

<p>At tea Mr. Bang informed us of a bazaar
to be held in the evening, at which the Government
House party would attend. This filled
me with joyous anticipation. I would for the
first time cast eyes on a real, live Lord, and
his Lady, and their noble family. I wonder
what they will look like. I am interested
because my grandmother, my mother’s
mother, was the grand-daughter of an earl.
Poor little me! It does not do me much good—those
exalted antecedents!</p>

<p>At dinner we had a dissertation on guinea-pig
directors. When a rascally promoter
wishes to lend credit to his enterprise he
employs a guinea-pig director to act for him
or, when the promoter has a reputation and is
careful of it he does the same. The guinea-pig
director must be of commanding presence,
have a title, or some notoriety to give his name
value and be able to make an after-dinner
speech. Colonel Grass is a professional
guinea-pig; Colonel Sir Lancelot Pill is lapsing
that way.</p>

<p>“Colonel Sir Lancelot Pill!” I exclaimed,
“why I thought he was one of our highest
citizens.”</p>

<p>“I have no doubt,” responded Mr. Bang,
“he would feel grateful could he hear you
say so: he gives away vast amounts of money
but then he can only do that because the public
buy his wares. But Sir Lancelot began to
lose cast ever since he promoted ‘The Slough
of Despond’.”</p>

<p>‘The Slough of Despond’ it appears was a
mining venture capitalized for an enormous
sum.</p>

<p>“When Sir Lancelot found the boom had
burst and the public would not buy the stock,
he conceived the idea of asking authority
from the Legislature for the company to
buy in its own stock. This was granted—which
shows what fools make our laws—and
the gallant Colonel used his company’s treasury
to support the market. And then with
quotations marked up by such unusual methods,
another shuffle of the cards took place
and the stock was issued in London to the
accompaniment of more market rigging. So
do our patriots establish our credit abroad.”</p>

<p>“How on earth did Sir Lancelot ever get
such authority?” asked Uncle.</p>

<p>“There is only one way: he went to Wee
Macgregor, who in turn fixed it up with the
Mulligan Guards.”</p>

<p>“What a name!” I exclaimed. “Who—”</p>

<p>“The Mulligan Guards is our Conservative
Club where our members foregather to select
the sheep from the goats, barter and sell our
legislation. Wee Macgregor was a lawyer and
no doubt he received an enormous fee in the
guise of a reward for professional service.
What do our farmers know of high finance?”</p>

<p>“Here I should have thought was a chance
for Timkins—”</p>

<p>“Timkins did—but what was the result.
Some years afterwards Timkins decided,
being a good Tory and the Mulligans being a
good lunching club, to go up for election. He
was turned down. Think of it, a man of Timkin’s
brains and character being refused
membership of the Mulligan Guards—”</p>

<p>“Rather thick,” commented Uncle.</p>

<p>“Time was when clubs were supposed to be
homes for gentlemen. To-day, from such
point of view our clubs are jokes. Politics,
finance, and society are intimately interwoven.
Our society is no better than our politics, and
our finance is as rotten as its two associates.
Colonel Sir Lancelot Pill was able to employ
our legislature to put one over on the British
Public. Timkins was kept out of the Mulligan
Guards to wreck a personal spite, and all
this in our enlightened age, our democratic
age.”</p>

<p>“How did Sir Lancelot get his title?” I
asked.</p>

<p>“He lent the Prince—”</p>

<p>“That be blowed for a story!” broke in Mr.
Bang. “He carried a speculative account for
one of Laurier’s Ministers, an old reprobate,
and the game ended up two hundred thousand
dollars to the bad. Pill accepted a knighthood
as the only thing to be had in the premises.
There is nothing in the white charger—Prince
story.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” ventured Uncle, meekly, “it is
quite on the cards the knighthood was a complete
‘quid pro quo’?”</p>

<p>“Quite, oh quite,” agreed Mr. Bang, “most
useful for stock market purposes.”</p>

<p>The bazaar, I found just like bazaars at
home, only larger; and Lord and Lady
Saffron had nothing remarkable about them,
while Ladies Margaret, Muriel and Millicent
were dressed quite dowdily. To me the three
girls seemed ordinary, and one of them, Lady
Muriel, stood talking to Mr. Bang before
everybody for quite a long time. I know the
people of Ottawa did not like it, from a conversation
I overheard.</p>

<p>During the evening Mr. Bang went off by
himself to play roulette and evidently after
this had palled on him, wandered among the
booths and soon met Lady Muriel, who was
selling tickets for a lottery. I happened to
see them meet, for Mumsie, who had fallen in
with an old acquaintance was engaged, and
so I had nothing to do but to see everything
and hear everything I could. Two ladies were
conversing in the most English of accents.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why their Excellencies allow
their daughters to take so much interest in a
beastly bazaar. Bazaars are all the same,
wretched things. I came of course, because of
the vice-regals.”</p>

<p>“I quite agree with you. Look at Lady
Muriel, selling tickets just like any common
girl! And who is that she is talking with?
Oh, really this is too much.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, really. Ask Montie.”</p>

<p>The other called to a man, evidently their
cavalier, and asked him who Mr. Bang was.</p>

<p>“Oh that fellow,” was the ready response
in contemptuous tones, “he comes to Ottawa
often. He is a railway navvy, contractor, or
something like that. I’ve seen him about the
hotels.”</p>

<p>“How dreadful! Just a common navvy. I
suppose he’s made money some way. I’ll—”</p>

<p>At this point in the conversation the ladies
had sauntered beyond my hearing.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 11th.</span></span></p>

<p>At breakfast this morning I said to Mr.
Bang, “You had quite a long conversation
with Lady Muriel Saffron last evening.”</p>

<p>“Did I? I was not aware of the fact,” he
responded coldly.</p>

<p>“Why, you were standing talking to her for
five or ten minutes: I heard one lady ask
another who you were.”</p>

<p>“Not really?” In saying this Mr. Bang’s
voice seemed more affected than natural. Possibly
it was an expression of sarcasm.</p>

<p>“Indeed you did,” I affirmed.</p>

<p>“I did not know it was Lady Muriel I was
talking to, but I am not surprised, as her
manners were very good, and her sentiments
worthy and gracious.”</p>

<p>Never have I known Mr. Bang to talk with
greater assurance. I felt snubbed.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say Lady Muriel talked
with you all that time, without knowing who
you were, or anything about you, and without
a formal introduction?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, why not?”</p>

<p>I looked from Mumsie to Uncle, but the
former was abstracted, and the latter deep in
the columns of the <span class='it'>Citizen</span>.</p>

<p>“Auntie, who were the females my Little
Partner heard talking about me last evening?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know,” replied Mumsie.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang’s voice was such that it seemed
as if he were imitating the ladies who had
complained. I smiled expectantly.</p>

<p>“Did they use the English accent?” asked
he.</p>

<p>“I believe they did,” I replied.</p>

<p>“They were probably members of the Government
House set—”</p>

<p>“I thought them English,” I ventured.</p>

<p>“Which shows only that you lack experience.”
That was rather blunt.</p>

<p>A moment’s pause and then Mr. Bang
continued, “You know there are lots of old
maids in Ottawa.”</p>

<p>“Now, Jack, leave the ladies alone,” protested
Mumsie. But unfortunately my curiosity
got the better of my dignity and my
loyalty to my sex.</p>

<p>“Ottawa young ladies won’t look at men of
their own class, the sons of civil servants, but
set their caps towards Government House.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said weariedly.</p>

<p>“To them the aides are the only fish in the
matrimonial sea.”</p>

<p>“Have they caught many?”</p>

<p>“In this particular they remind me of the
Irishman at sea, who fell asleep on the look-out.
‘Ahoy’ called the mate. No answer.
‘Ahoy’ again called the mate, and this time the
awakened salt replied:—‘Shoo! Shoo! Sir,
whist! I’m ketchin’ rats.’ ‘How many have
you caught?’ asked the mate. ‘When I ketch
this one and two more I’ll have three.’ Now
when Ottawa society ketches one aide and
then—”</p>

<p>“Hush Jack, somebody may hear you,”
pleaded Mumsie, and our breakfast ended in
silence. I wonder if Mr. Bang has proposed
to some Ottawa girl and been refused!</p>

<p>After breakfast we wandered into the
lounge, where we found Mr. Fraser. Mr.
Bang led us to him saying,</p>

<p>“You have been in Ottawa off and on, over
many years, what is the origin of the English
accent here?”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser looked up from his paper, rose
to his feet, and after we were seated answered,
“It’s barrack-room English, that’s what it
is.”</p>

<p>“Barrack-room English!—surely not?”</p>

<p>“Yes it is: I lived in Halifax for thirty
years and I know.”</p>

<p>“But it’s not the voice of Tommy Atkins—”</p>

<p>“No, it is the voice in which the senior
Major’s wife calls over the back fence to the
neighbouring officer’s lady to know if she can
have the loan of some hair-pins. Lord! how
I hate it!”</p>

<p>“The English accent as an affectation,” interposed
Uncle, “has been handed down for
generations.”</p>

<p>“If it is of ancient lineage here, it has died
out in England,” said Mr. Bang with his usual
assurance. “One does not hear it in Piccadilly
or on the promenade at Eastbourne.”</p>

<p>“They take it as the correct thing, here in
Ottawa.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser was interrupted by Mr. Bang,
who said: “I often thought—when in England
I noticed its absence—that it would be
a good thing if Ottawa were to send a delegation
to London to furnish instruction in the
English accent. Now here’s an idea for you:
introduce a Bill in Parliament bearing out
this suggestion. You’d make a name for
yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’d make an ass of myself. Leave the
society people alone, if it amuses them it cannot
do us much harm—”</p>

<p>“They should be sat upon,” said Mr. Bang.
“What are English people to think of us when
they hear such whinings uttered in all earnestness—”</p>

<p>“A visitor who would draw his estimate of
a people after merely a survey of the court
circle, would show such disregard for history
and such general shallowness, that it would
not matter what he thought.”</p>

<p>I felt this remark would appeal to Mr.
Bang. His only comment was:</p>

<p>“Yes, and the Government House set of
Ottawa corresponds to a court circle.”</p>

<p>“Exactly, and you know the stories they tell
about our Government House set. One is that
a visitor one day found a number of young
ladies in the drawing-room playing a game
with one of the aides. The young gallant
would sit on a chair and a damsel would sit
on his knee, another on her knee, and so on
with the others until the line of damsels on
the young aide’s knee would stretch across
the room. Then he would stand up and all of
them would fall amid shrieks of laughter.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser told this with such satisfaction
that he angered me; I was still more angered
when Uncle remarked:—</p>

<p>“Sounds as if it were an incident culled
from memoirs of Charles the Second.”</p>

<p>“Do you know whether the story is true or
not,” I asked.</p>

<p>“No! I told it as current gossip to be taken
for what it is worth,” replied Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“Quite likely it’s true: it’s not much worse
than the ‘What-a-liar-you-are’ story,” said
Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>I was so annoyed that I would not give Mr.
Bang an opportunity to exercise his bitterness,
so I held my tongue and did not ask the
perhaps expected question. Mumsie was not
so wise, and gave him the opening.</p>

<p>“This is of a maiden from the prairies, who
went to dinner at Government House. An
aide was commissioned to take her in to dinner
and she asked him whether she should
wear her gloves at the table. The aide replied,
‘Yes,’ but when the young lady found she had
been deceived, she immediately tore off her
gloves, remarking, as she did so, ‘What a liar
you are.’ This story has become an Ottawa
classic.”</p>

<p>“How could such a girl get an invitation
to Government House?” I demanded, “surely———”</p>

<p>“She had de beeg pull wid Laurier,” replied
Uncle.</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser smiled and remarked.</p>

<p>“You Tories will never forget that story.”</p>

<p>“Please tell it to me,” I was glad of a
change.</p>

<p>“You tell it, Bang,” requested Fraser.</p>

<p>“No, you tell it,” and so requests and protests
were bandied. At last Mr. Fraser complied.</p>

<p>“A French-Canadian, a habitant farmer,
met a compatriot one January day some years
ago, and remarked:</p>

<p>“ ‘Queen Victoria shees dead.’</p>

<p>“ ‘Queen Victoria shees dead! who get shees
job?’</p>

<p>“ ‘Prince of Wales gets shees job.’</p>

<p>“ ‘By gosh, dat Prince of Wales feller mus’
have beeg pull wid Laurier.’</p>

<p>“From what I have seen and heard,” then
said Mr. Bang, “I believe Ottawa society
would accept a Hottentot lady and swear she
was Diana, so long as she came as a Minister’s
wife.”</p>

<p>“I hope you don’t refer to the heroine of
the ‘What-a-liar-you-are’ story, for she is
quite a friend of mine,” said Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“Do you find her amusing?”</p>

<p>“Quite.”</p>

<p>I felt satisfied that the young lady referred
to had snubbed Mr. Bang at some time. His
rancour must have been born of personal
spite. So I made some remark to that effect,
smiling sweetly.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang ignored my jibe for a moment;
and then he told the following story:</p>

<p>“Once I was staying at Ottawa for some
days. Some person told me it was the custom
for visitors to call upon the wives of Ministers.
Why people should desire to call, or
why the obligation to receive all and sundry
should be thrown upon Ministers’ wives, I
don’t know; but, being idle, I called upon one
of them. I knew the daughter of the house
and talked to her for the regulation five minutes,
and then made a motion to leave. The
girl begged me to stay, and I stayed. From
my corner of the room, the constant stream of
frivolity in and out amused me, it was a
novelty. I stayed, making myself useful, until
the ebb set in and then I went away. I
attended the rink that evening and the first
thing I heard was that I had visited at a Minister’s
house that afternoon and stayed over
an hour. This girl had asked me to overstay
custom for the sole purpose of having something
to gossip about. Knowing that she and
her people were a source of innocent merriment,
she planned to make me, in turn, an
object of ridicule. But can any civilized being
understand the mind that would stoop to such
folly? Yet Ottawa accepted these people, as
‘so quaint don’t you know?’ They were
quaint indeed.”</p>

<p>To-day was not as cold as yesterday, and we
went for a drive. We drove about Rockcliffe
and through the grounds of Government
House—Rideau Hall. At dinner Uncle announced
that he had secured tickets for an
exhibition of skating to be held this evening.</p>

<p>Such skating as I saw I had never before
pictured in the wildest flights of fancy. There
was skating free, and skating in pairs, and
there were figures done by fours. Such grace,
such rhythmic motion, such ease, such exactness!
And the music, the band helped one to
ecstasy. One would think to watch the skating
that those people had been bred to it, they
swung from circle to circle with such marvellous
ease and assurance.</p>

<p>The dance of the fairies will ever live in
my memory. The rink was darkened and a
shaft of green light was thrown upon the ice.
Over the ice came a band of maidens led by a
most beautiful skater of delightful form,
swaying and flitting, their white draperies
responding to their motions which were tuned
to the music. The leader came down the
middle of the ice, her followers filed at the
sides. They were as sprites. I’m sure nothing
so lovely was ever seen before. They filled
the rink, swayed, marked time, as it were, and
then retreated. They went as they came,
rhythmic, beautiful.</p>

<p>There were other scenes, pageants, call them
what you will, but I paid little heed to them.
The dance of the fairies had appealed to me
so strongly that the others made little impression.
And then when the lights went up after
the dance of the fairies, I saw among the
spectators Charlie Lien. It made me sick at
heart. I had decided, as the vulgar say, to
cut him out; and now—I found my heart
pounding. All my resolutions faded as a fog-bank
dissolves before the rising sun. Oh
dear!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 12th.</span></span></p>

<p>Charlie Lien met me in a corridor this
morning. He is staying at this hotel. He says
he came down to play in a hockey match this
evening. Had it been possible I would have
avoided him. He had evidently planned to
give me no such opportunity. He addressed
me with: “Hello, old girl.” And then protested
life was no good without me, he must
have someone on whom to spend his money.
He invited me to drive out in the afternoon
with him to Aylmer. I declined. He drew
me into a recess and used his every art to
break my resolve. I allowed him to kiss me, to
put his arm about me, but I held to my determination
and made no response. To give the
devil his due, as Dad would say, he did not tell
me he loved me. But then, perhaps, he knew
that if he told me he loved me I would ask him
if he desired to marry me. So perhaps I am
more than just to him. In any case these
reflections helped me to gather my wits together
and I calmly walked away from him.
From first to last I had not uttered a word.</p>

<p>Away from him at first I felt sorry I had
not accepted his invitation—and then glad.
How strangely are we, am I, constituted.
There is something attractive and something
offensive about that young man.</p>

<p>This evening there was a concert in the
drawing-room. Like the bazaar, it was in aid
of charity; and like the bazaar was under
vice-regal patronage. There were songs and
a speech from His Excellency. Then a painting
by Lady Muriel was to be auctioned. The
gathering was all very grand and interesting.
Ministers high in the Government and their
wives were present. The dresses were gorgeous.</p>

<p>The picture Lady Muriel had painted and
which was to be sold was a log cabin in the
forest with a mountain towering in the background.
Mr. Bang, I noticed, regarded it
with a critical eye. I could notice that Lady
Muriel had her mind on it; and when it was
put on sale became visibly interested. She
was standing with her mother and sisters, and
with them also was a good-looking man, who
I afterwards learned was generally known as
Dapper Dicky.</p>

<p>“How much am I offered for the picture?”
asked the auctioneer.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five dollars,” replied Dapper
Dicky over his shoulder. He was deep in conversation
with Her Excellency.</p>

<p>“One hundred dollars,” bid a voice at my
side. It was Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“One hundred and twenty-five,” came from
Dapper Dicky.</p>

<p>“One hundred and fifty,” bid Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“One hundred and seventy-five,” responded
the other, glancing again over his shoulder in
an endeavour to see who was opposing him.</p>

<p>“And fifty would be a big price for it,”
Uncle whispered in his nephew’s ear.</p>

<p>“Two hundred dollars,” offered Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Two hundred and fifty,” cried Dapper
Dicky.</p>

<p>“Three hundred,” came from Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Those present became interested and stared
at Mr. Bang. Evidently he alone was the
object of curiosity.</p>

<p>Dapper Dicky was evidently known to them.
And he evidently was curious also. He gazed
at Mr. Bang in a wondering sort of way and
with an expression, which told that he did not
exactly know where he was.</p>

<p>“Four hundred dollars,” he bid.</p>

<p>“Five hundred dollars,” bid Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Good Lord I thought, can it be that Mr.
Bang has had his head turned by Lady Muriel
and is going to ruin himself?</p>

<p>Dapper Dicky became visibly confused.</p>

<p>“Six hundred dollars.”</p>

<p>“Six hundred and twenty-five,” bid Mr.
Bang.</p>

<p>“Ah,” I thought, “Mr. Bang is becoming
more cautious.”</p>

<p>“Six hundred and fifty.”</p>

<p>“Seven hundred.”</p>

<p>Mr. Bang offering seven hundred dollars for
a picture not worth, as Uncle said, fifty!</p>

<p>“Eight hundred dollars,” retorted Dapper
Dicky, whose full attention was now devoted
to his opponent. His eyes were flashing in
anger.</p>

<p>“Nine hundred,” bid Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars,” spluttered his
opponent, while the company was lost in wonderment.
No further word came from Mr.
Bang.</p>

<p>“Any advance on one thousand dollars?”
questioned the auctioneer. There was a silence
as if of the tomb.</p>

<p>“Sold,” called the auctioneer.</p>

<p>“Come and have some supper, all of you,
and I’ll invite Fraser.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser was gathered in and Mr. Bang
marshalled us all towards the dining-room.</p>

<p>“Will you tell me what in the name of goodness
you mean, by offering nine hundred dollars
for a picture, not much better than I
could do myself?” demanded Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Now Auntie! do give me credit for a little
sense—common sense—and sense of humour!
I had no intention of buying the thing.”</p>

<p>“What did you bid for then?”</p>

<p>“Don’t you know who that was I was bidding
against?” Mr. Bang in turn demanded.</p>

<p>“Your nephew was bidding against Dapper
Dicky,” explained Mr. Fraser, in matter of
fact tones.</p>

<p>“It was amusing to see the expression on his
face, when he found he had opposition. He is
accustomed to have it all his own way. Now
if you only knew Dapper Dicky—”</p>

<p>“He is not half a bad fellow, in fact a very
decent fellow, I’ve found,” said Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“Who is he, what is he?” demanded Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Up till a few short months ago, he was a
staunch supporter of the Liberal Government.
He sold us many things, and made much
money and then—”</p>

<p>“And then the Government changed, and
so did Dicky,” interjected Mr. Bang. “ ‘You
know,’ he said as he shook hands with one of
Borden’s ministers, ‘I always was with you.
I really never did care for these damned
Grits.’ ”</p>

<p>“I believe, now, to make doubly sure, he has
taken into partnership Colonel Nimble. Colonel
Nimble is a life-long supporter of the
party in power and will be able on that score,
to command inordinate profits from them,”
said Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“By the way, what is the Government going
to do with Tom and Jerry,” asked Mr. Bang,
looking into the Member’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Give ’em a hundred million or more I
suppose, what else can they do?”</p>

<p>“Let ’em bust,” suggested Mr. Bang
savagely.</p>

<p>“It would bring ruination to Canada, spoil
our credit,” said Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“Bosh! it would do us good, shake things
down to rock bottom, make us quit gambling
and go to work. In this country, the net result
of most people losing their money is that they
begin to lead useful lives.”</p>

<p>“It would never do, you are joking. The
banks, the money of the widows and orphans.”</p>

<p>“What most politicians and financiers are
concerned about is their own money and
their own speculations,” suggested Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“The Canadian is a gambler no doubt,” said
Uncle, “but when he loses in the gamble he
cheerfully faces the issue.”</p>

<p>“But the trouble is that while he will cheerfully
face adverse fortune himself, he expects
others to accept the fate he brings them with
equal nonchalance,” objected the disagreeable
one.</p>

<p>“You Tories are to blame for Tom and
Jerry’s road, the ‘Poverty, Distress and
Want’,” claimed Mr. Fraser.</p>

<p>“I deny the allegation,” retorted Uncle with
affected heat.</p>

<p>“Laurier wasted over two hundred million
dollars on the Transcontinental,” said Mr.
Bang. “The road was built to win the support
of Quebec. So the price we pay for the
honour of having Laurier Prime Minister for
two extra terms is at least two hundred million
dollars.”</p>

<p>“The road will pay some day and be
regarded as a blessing.”</p>

<p>“That is a delightful possibility. But I
know, know with a big ‘K,’ that the reason
the Transcontinental was built was to hold
Laurier in power. Quebec is always ready for
public expenditure—within Quebec. The
habitant makes his own whiskey, grows his
own tobacco, pays no taxes. If debt is heaped
up he can look on with indifference.”</p>

<p>“My man,” thought I, “you certainly have
your knife out for the Canadian French.”</p>

<p>“Do you think,” asked Uncle, looking at
Mr. Fraser, “that the Government of to-day is
any improvement on that constituted by the
Family Compact in Ontario?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, our present Government is by
the people.”</p>

<p>“But as a Government, I mean, are officials
more conscientious, more honest, does the man
in the street fare better, is there less waste of
public money?”</p>

<p>“I think so! Yes.”</p>

<p>“Is working a graft less pernicious when
carried out by an elected representative, than
when it is done by a member of an autocracy
like the Family Compact?”</p>

<p>“They call it graft here; while in England
it is known as ‘family influence’,” cut in Mr.
Bang. “This was a distinction framed by an
Englishman I knew in Dawson City.”</p>

<p>“There is no difference,” acknowledged
Mr. Fraser in reply to Uncle’s question.</p>

<p>“What was the Family Compact?” I asked.</p>

<p>“As its name implies, a compact that lorded
over Ontario in the old days.”</p>

<p>“It came to an end after the William Lyon
MacKenzie rebellion. MacKenzie, with a
bunch of Scotch Grits and devil-dodgers, set
out to be the father of a Northern Revolution.
The scheme failed after a little bloodshed.
Since that time, the descendants of the leaders
have used so much ink in trying to show how
the rebellion was justified and its results
meritorious, that the poor old Family Compact
has suffered badly.”</p>

<p>“Poor Family Compact,” murmured Mr.
Fraser in mock tones of condolence.</p>

<p>“People who use doubtful means invariably
complain that their opponents were the first
to be unfair,” continued Mr. Bang, who was
quite unruffled. “This is a process much used
by the Yankees since their revolution, and it
apparently has secured them peace of mind.”</p>

<p>And so banter was indulged in and our supper
ended pleasantly. I learned what a devil-dodger
is. “There are those who tread the
straight and narrow way from love of God;
others from fear of the devil,—and these are
the devil-dodgers. Scotch Grits are mostly
devil-dodgers,” said Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“It requires the highest type of patriotism
to prompt an honest Canadian to devote his
life to politics,” so said Uncle.</p>

<p>“That ‘the Government of a people is as
good as they deserve’ is an old saying, and
Canada is no exception. Our press panders
to the rich. Our Governments confer knight-hoods
on grafters, financial adventurers, and
corruptionists—” this from Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>Uncle chimed in, “Democracy is an experiment
to which the regent has yet to be
applied.”</p>

<p>“Man is a mean and vicious animal, and the
process of ‘trusting the people’ must bring
trouble to the world.”—Mr. Bang.</p>

<p>“Virtue is an abnormal development.”—Uncle.</p>

<p>“Society is the folly of the day.”—Mr.
Fraser.</p>

<p>“Class prejudice is the strongest lever in
politics.”—Mr. Bang. Clatter! Clatter! Clatter!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 13th.</span></span></p>

<p>I sat through the Opening of Parliament
without a word. Gossip, comment, praise, and
ridicule, bombarded my ears from four sides.
I was lost in reverie. I once more reviewed
my experiences, aims, and aspirations, the
workings of my mind, and my schemings,
since I came to Mumsie; and while my ways
have been devious I seem to have journeyed
from nowhere to—the same no—place. My
first effort towards making friends with Mrs.
Mount has, as Mr. Bang would say, “petered
out.” This ambition was lost in those newer
impulses that came from contact with Charlie
Lien. How can I analyze them? Coming like
a thought, a visitation from space, from
infinity, I do not recognize them and I may
not ask. Had I now a mother—Ah! Mumsie
is a dear—it is with that sentence I began this
diary—but I am not of her; flesh of her flesh,
mind of her mind. Had I a mother, I could
ask her and she could explain to me this
development of what Uncle and Mr. Bang call
the “social bug.”</p>

<p>And then the rest!</p>

<p>Mr. Bang’s fairy tale to little Jessie, the
story of Ambition, really does not parallel my
case, for I have not climbed. I have not had
even the fleeting breath of happiness enjoyed
by the “beautiful young lady,” while still she
was amid the flowers of Friendship and Truth.
Perhaps had I never met Charlie Lien and
really had luck in securing somebody like
Mrs. Mount to take an interest in me, I might
have enjoyed that fleeting measure of reward.
And the flowers of Friendship and Truth!—I
had uprooted and trod them under foot that
is true. But it is this blowing hot and cold
over Charlie Lien that mystifies me—I seem
to control myself so little, where he is concerned.</p>

<p>In his court dress, His Excellency, standing
before his Senators, their wives and daughters,
the High Court officials with their wives
and daughters, and the Members of Parliament;
the reading of his words of commendation
and hope, all appealed to me, as being of
a world to which I truly belonged. To me
the assembled officials in their robes, spoke of
a world with which my ancestors were intimate.
Perhaps such thoughts are in keeping
with the inherent process of ancestor worship—that
Mr. Bang and Uncle say is ours.
In any case, as I have before set down, I can
find in it nothing but good.</p>

<p>It was an impressive scene, a pageant of far
more potency than any mere form would
cause. It spoke of great loyalty, a rule of
faith and love. Altogether it was elevating
and ennobling. I thank His Excellency for
it: I thank Mr. Bang for it. I must not forget,
or rather I must try and remember the
extent of my indebtedness to him. I am certain
that my mind was widened and broadened
by this great experience.</p>

<p>There is quite a lot of ceremony about the
Opening of Parliament. It always starts at
three in the afternoon, and there are those
who can get entree to the floor of the Senate
Chamber by way of the entrance behind the
dais. That is if they have enough “pull.”
But I won’t bother with that.</p>

<p>The drowsiness developed by my musings,
and the heat of the Senate Chamber, was
quickly dispelled on our return to the Hotel
by meeting Mrs. Mount.</p>

<p>“Why Mrs. Mount,” exclaimed Mumsie, on
finding her in the rotunda.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount looked at us coldly, said: “How
do you do,” and started away on a long tirade.</p>

<p>“I got so beastly tired of home and, do you
know, I said to Doris that I really thought
we must have a change. Doris has never yet
attended a Drawing-room,” etc., etc. It was
a long dissertation about her habits and doings.
She was evidently a guest of the Hotel,
so was not the guest of Lady Matthews. Nor
did she offer any explanation of the difference
from what she had led us to expect. Probably
she had forgotten the account she gave
us a week or so ago, wherein Lady Matthews,—“Clair
as I always call her”—had invited
her to the opening. Mrs. Mount I’m afraid,
has lost her novelty for me, and I’m with
Uncle in putting her beyond the pale.</p>

<p>Mr. Bang was most attentive to-day. Probably
my latest mood has attracted him.
Still I cannot reconcile myself to the thought
of inscribing on my visiting card, “Mrs.
Bang.”</p>

<p>After the opening I fell into a long conversation
with Mr. Fraser. He is a pleasant
man to talk to. And I can quite understand
how his chief is the charming personality
everybody says he is.</p>

<p>“It is not wonderful,” said he, “that you
find Mr. Bang a strange character. He is of
the school of many years ago. Changes of
temperament, like fashions, develop in the
great centres, the capitals of Europe. Jack’s
tricks of mind are of another age handed
down from generation to generation, true to
its parent culture, that culture which took life
seriously and whose chief diversion was controversy.
His ideals are of that school and
have been impervious to change.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I see,” I agreed, in no positive tone.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if I have made myself clear,”
continued Mr. Fraser, “but perhaps you may
better understand what I mean when I tell
you, that French scholars say they find in
Quebec phrases and expressions that have
been dead for ages in France. So old habits
of thought are still with us. Jack is, however,
one of the best of fellows.”</p>

<p>Mr. Fraser’s tone in speaking of Mr. Bang
is most sympathetic which reconciles me somewhat
to the man, if not to his name.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 14th.</span></span></p>

<p>“Oh, Mrs. Somers,” blustered Mrs. Mount
to Mumsie when I was with her in the drawing-room
this morning, “I have had such a
shock, such a shock and do you know, really,
I don’t exactly know <span class='it'>how</span> I am to get over it.”</p>

<p>“Why, what can the matter be?” asked
Mumsie, responding to the evidences of distress
with measurable interest.</p>

<p>“Oh! I have had a shock, such a dreadful
shock———”</p>

<p>“What is it?” again demanded Mumsie,
apprehensively, while I felt like quoting: “Oh
dear! what can the matter be?”</p>

<p>“Do you know, really, I have always understood
that my Doris was to have the most
expensive dress at the Opening, and now, do
you know what I have discovered? I have
found out that a horrid American creature,
a Miss Spruce from New York, has arrived
and is to wear a dress costing no less than ten
thousand dollars—ten thousand dollars—think
of that! Dear! dear! dear!” and the
good lady stamped her foot and protruded
her chin.</p>

<p>“That is too bad, it must be a great disappointment,”
said Mumsie in the most sympathetic
tones, “but then Doris may be—I
have no doubt is—a very much better-looking
girl than Miss Spruce.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, yes; no, no, no; that is, Doris is
much the better-looking girl, certainly. Doris
is so sweet, so graceful, so everything don’t
you know, really, but then you know these
American creatures make up so wonderfully
———”</p>

<p>“Can’t you have Doris make up too?” suggested
Mumsie with innocence sublime.</p>

<p>“But everybody will know Miss Spruce’s
dress has cost ten thousand dollars, they do
already, you know. I’ve heard it from half
a dozen people and she has been in the hotel
only one hour—only one hour—just fancy!”</p>

<p>Mumsie affected a fitting expression of
amazement, which I copied to the best of my
ability.</p>

<p>“Only one hour!” repeated Mumsie in doleful
tones, and then pitching her voice to a key
of joyousness cried: “Don’t tell anybody and
they will never know Doris’s did not cost ten
thousand dollars—nobody will know the difference
———”</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount gazed at Mumsie as if she were
deciding whether to shriek or cry. She did
not do either, but in a voice sepulchral murmured:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Somers, I’ve already told twenty
people that Doris’s dress cost one thousand
dollars. As a matter of fact, it really only
cost six hundred and fifty, but I said a thousand
as I always like to deal in round figures.
All Ottawa has heard of Doris’s thousand
dollar dress, and that I cabled to Paris for it.
There is nothing for it; I’m beat, I’m beat.
And, by a beastly Yankee whose father made
his money out of chewing-gum. Chewing gum!
just fancy!” Mrs. Mount wore an air of complete
defeat as she walked away.</p>

<p>As Mrs. Mount left us, Uncle and Mr. Bang
came up, and Mumsie recounted the scene with
admirable skill. Uncle was highly amused
and laughed immoderately; Mr. Bang being in
a less doleful frame of mind than usual, became
almost gleeful. Dear old Mumsie!</p>

<p>Uncle then informed us that he must leave
for home by the Sunday morning train. This
was a disappointment to us, of course, and
then Mr. Bang said:</p>

<p>“Auntie, I learn that Norway Lake Hotel
is the last word of comfort and—as Elsie will
be pleased to hear—fashion. We can leave
here Sunday morning and be there at three in
the afternoon. And, do you know—I won’t
add the ‘really,’ unless my ears or understanding
played me false—Mrs. Mount is also——”</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Mount is going that fact will give
Norway Lake its certificate,” cut in Mumsie.</p>

<p>I stood limp—Norway Lake!—not Mrs.
Mount or her daughter was the person to
whom my mind flew, but Charlie Lien. But
what could I say—do? For a healthy debutante
to decline to go to a winter resort, such
a winter resort as Norway House, would be
suspicious. I said nothing.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 15th.</span></span></p>

<p>It is all over; I have made my bow. I am
really in society. In a great, gloomy corridor
hundred and hundreds of us stood for hours,
trampling on each other. The human sand
ran very slow, but at long last we—I—filed in.
Battered and bruised I passed up the aisle
underneath the gallery and handed my card
to an aide. In stentorian tones he announced
my name, but although his voice was good and
strong, I felt it falling on an indifferent
world. I passed into the limelight, curtesied
to His Excellency and then to Her Excellency.
It was over. Only a moment, and it was done.</p>

<p>The faces of their Excellencies, as I paid
tribute, were smiling kindly. Standing to the
left of their Excellencies were their daughters.
We passed, the procession passed, in
front of them, and out: and then upstairs
into the gallery, where I took my stand and
watched those coming after. This is all there
is to making one bow, except getting one’s
bouquet crushed; and yet as a ceremony it
means much. I am in Society.</p>

<p>After it was over, back to the hotel we went.
This as a dress parade was a greater success
than the Drawing-room, for the really grand
dresses simply swarmed in, and a better look
was to be had of them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Mount, Doris and Miss Spruce were
included in one party. Our own was very
happy, in fact, I felt more genuinely happy
than I have been since my first advent to
Mumsie’s home. Of course, Mr. Bang abused
the Scotch Grits and the Yankees, but not to
excess this time.</p>

<p>Mumsie asked Mr. Bang what practical
good there was in abusing the Yankees, to
which he replied:</p>

<p>“Auntie, if one believes the Yankee version
of their Revolution, and the causes thereof,
he must conclude the Loyalists, our ancestors,
were a people lacking in virility. To the everlasting
harm of our country our own schools
teach that twaddle. British schools teach it,
because it is the essence of Whig doctrine, and
the Whigs and the Liberals are fully alive to
the policy of catching recruits young.”</p>

<p>“But what harm does it do?” persisted
Mumsie.</p>

<p>“Simply that the English youth emigrating
to America choses Yankee-land instead of
Canada. And here in Canada, our young men,
having been taught to despise their fathers,
and respect the Yankees, have left their homes
for the mammon of unrighteousness. But
now a change is at hand. To-day Canada is
the land of opportunity. The United States
has reached the apex of its prosperity, it is
becoming a tired people. The tide is flowing
with us and our young men are staying at
home.”</p>

<p>Were this diary a novel, I should now bring
it to a close. What a sorry tale it is, telling
only of failure, at least on my part. And
what a halting lover Mr. Bang would make,
providing he is a lover; I cannot help thinking.
And Charlie Lien is tame even as a villain,
but then he might be doctored up. A
little bit of melodrama! What a pity the
mock-marriage and the abduction is so worn
out. Surely I can invent at least a new staging
for the old theme. Perhaps if I can do so,
all this, my writing, will not have been in
vain. Indeed in a month I have felt the
impelling force of ambition, and all the pangs
that come from humiliation.</p>

<p>A strange mixing will take place at Norway
House—Mrs. Lien, the women of wealth, in
whom ennui is a genuine complaint; Mrs.
Mount, who envies Mrs. Lien, but cannot command
courage enough to affect her pose; Mumsie,
dear old Mumsie! Mr. Bang, Charlie Lien
and—. Here is a setting for an inventive
mind, scope for the villain’s villainy, field for
a hero’s heroism. Who might be the hero?
Could Mr. Bang be a hero? He hasn’t quite
the name.</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 17th.</span></span></p>

<p>Jack Bang has saved my life and I hate
him! How I hate him! I know now the meaning
of “a consuming hate.” My heart seems
of lead. I am frightened because I hate him
so much.</p>

<p>Charlie Lien was taking me down the
toboggan slide when it happened. Mrs. Lien
and Mrs. Mount were there, each with a
cavalier; and Mumsie with Mr. Bang. Charlie
and I had reached the head of the stairs and
had placed our toboggan ready and I had just
seated myself. Mrs. Mount was next in turn
and was talking to Charlie.</p>

<p>“Do you know, really, Mr. Lien, I think you
are the nicest young man I ever met. You
are such a good sport, and so good to everybody,
even if they don’t amount to anything
———”</p>

<p>At this point I felt the toboggan move, and
a moment after a number of shrieks, and then
a great thump behind and then—a hundred
sensations. The toboggan skidded this way
and that, first on one side of the slide and then
on the other, till it settled down to its arrow-like
course, by which time I was exhausted
through fright. To fortify myself I put my
arm behind me and with it encircled what I
thought was the head of Charlie Lien, murmuring,
“Oh, Charlie, oh! Charlie.”</p>

<p>Imagine my feelings when I found I had
the head of Mr. Bang. At the moment I would
willingly have severed my right hand to have
retrieved my mishap. Oh! oh! how can I
express my mortification? No words of mine
can tell.</p>

<p>I suppose Mumsie, and Uncle, and other old-fashioned
people would say that it was noble
of Mr. Bang to say “It was nothing,” and to
ignore the fact that I had put my arm about
his neck and called him Charlie. If he had
only appeared one whit more self-satisfied
after the occurrence, I believe I could almost
love him. But, possibly, for him to feel more
self-satisfied than he does is beyond his
capacity. And then if he had only smiled
even cynically when our eyes met at the bottom
of the slide, I could forgive him much—the
beast!</p>

<p>It all happened through that wretched
woman, Mrs. Mount, who wants him for a son-in-law,
trying to win him, I know. Charlie
let go the handles of the toboggan just a
moment to look at this audacious creature
when the toboggan slid off. Of course, without
its steersman it would have run over the
side of the run-way and I would have been
killed. But Mr. Bang, who was watching
everything as usual, made a spring as I passed
him and landed, where Charlie should have
been, behind me. He certainly did well after
he gained the steersman’s seat. Had he been
unable to steady the toboggan and we had
both gone over the run-way, we would have
been killed—wouldn’t we?</p>

<p>Of course, it broke up the tobogganning for
the morning. Everybody crowded round us.
Mumsie was almost as white as the snow when
she came up. Mrs. Lien was most sympathetic.
Others said nice things and then Mrs.
Mount, having reserved her fire until the last,
said: “Oh! Miss Travers, it was all so melographic.
We shall expect a romance to grow
out of this, shan’t we, Mrs. Somers?”</p>

<p>I was so angry I nearly fainted through the
effort I made in restraining myself. Of
course, too, I had no fitting retort ready. It
would be so nice if we would only have a stock
of retorts ready for use on emergency. And
I don’t believe there is any such word as melographic.</p>

<p>I know Mrs. Mount wants Charlie Lien for
her Doris, and this knowledge came through a
conversation I heard last night. Norway
House has wonderful acoustic properties.
Sounds come from everywhere, anywhere, and
last night as I lay in bed, I heard the following:</p>

<p>“But, Mother, the Travers girl is quite
good-looking, and I don’t see why Charlie
Lien should not marry her.”</p>

<p>“Doris,” came Mrs. Mount’s voice in the
severest tones, “You must not contradict
your mother. I say the Travers girl is not
nearly as good-looking as you are—you who
are all grace and beautiful as a cowslip in the
morning dew—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!”</p>

<p>“Now, don’t contradict—”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, Charlie has had Miss Travers
to lunch at the Hunt Club, and they’ve been
seen together several times.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Doris, you should know young
men will be young men. But it’s time Charlie
Lien began to look around serious-like—”</p>

<p>“But why should he fancy me?”</p>

<p>“That’s it, that’s it, that’s why I want you
to put your best foot forward, don’t you know,
really———”</p>

<p>“But Mother, if Mrs. Somers did not think
there was something in the affair between
Charlie and Miss Travers———”</p>

<p>“Now, Doris, I don’t want any more back
answerings. To show I ain’t a fool, I may
tell you that I’ve sounded Mrs. Somers and
have found out it’s the big fellow who has put
up the coin, so now! It’s all very plain—”</p>

<p>“But Mother, Mr. Bang is not paying Miss
Travers any attention.”</p>

<p>“Now, Doris, I have told you already I
don’t want any back answerings. You’re my
daughter, and I want to see you well married.
When I’m dying I don’t want to be thinking
of you sitting round a boarding-house about
the time you should be a grandmother.”</p>

<p>“There’s lots of time, Mother.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t lots of time, and you know it.
Don’t you know, really, there ain’t a Charlie
Lien to be picked up every day.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, I can’t pick him—”</p>

<p>“Doris,” the mother’s voice was rising in
anger, “what did I say about back answerings?”</p>

<p>“Well, Mother, do please give me time to
think. Assuming Charlie is having a harmless
flirtation—”</p>

<p>“Harmless flirtation, indeed, with a hussy
that has no money, and no good clothes to set
off what few good looks she has got—”</p>

<p>At this point I heard a door slam. Evidently
Doris had left her mamma whose voice
was getting coarser every second the controversy
continued. “Hussy indeed!” I
thought. Her Doris! Bah! But how in the
name of fortune did Doris learn of my doings
with Charlie Lien. Of course, no mention
was made of the Palm-room, which is a comfort.
And how coarse the mother’s voice
became as it gained in heat. Her “ain’ts”
and her “back answerings”—Oh! to think of
my having toadied to her! I painted her picture
at my age, a buxom slattern, that is what
she was, a slattern, the butt of every jolly
cavalier who felt a budding wit; bare feet,
possibly, and dirty petticoats, tattered and
torn! And her home, the tavern at the dusty
corner, the long intervals between the coming
and going of guests; the wild acclaim, the
shouted jest, the latest news from the seat
of war, political, or otherwise.</p>

<p>And to think that I, Elsie Travers, toadied
to her!</p>

<p>The conversation I have recorded I heard
on Sunday night. Of course, there has been
nothing else to record—beyond the fact that
we travelled by the same train as the Mounts.</p>

<p>And now to return to the thread of my narrative.
After the first flutter of excitement
and Mrs. Mount’s stab at matchmaking, I had
a fit of nerves and went to my room. I had
my lunch sent to me; I wished to think. And
I thought and thought; and then I realized
that all my effort could not hit upon a line of
action. What to do? Would that a fairy
would speak!</p>

<p>But a demon spoke—a demon, a hell-cat’s
words with the philosophy of Satan!</p>

<p>Shortly after lunch I heard the Mounts at it
again.</p>

<p>“I’m sure she’ll never marry him now.
What girl would marry a man who would
imperil her life so?”</p>

<p>“What do you know of diplomacy? Will
you answer me that now, you who was so fond
of back answering last night?”</p>

<p>“I—”</p>

<p>“I tell you, you know nothing. The girl’s
gone to bed, and her no more scared than you
be.”</p>

<p>“But, Mother, her nerves—”</p>

<p>“Her nerves, her nothing, all bunkum! She’s
gone to bed to ketch him. She’s going to ketch
him if you don’t look out. That’s what I’m
frightened of.”</p>

<p>“But how?”</p>

<p>“How—how—how? Don’t you know how
the chorus girls ketch the lordlings? Why,
keep him at a distance, you bet. I’ll tell you
she’s no fool, that girl is no fool. That fledgling
is a wise bird, as wise as the ‘chicken<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a>
wid de big eye.’ ”</p>

<p>“Will keeping a lordling at a distance catch
him?”</p>

<p>“Ketch him? Certainly, didn’t I say so
before. Keep him chasing, chasing, chasing
and never satisfy him until he pops.”</p>

<p>“Pops, Mother?”</p>

<p>“Pops the question, of course. Now mark
my words, see if the hussy does not pout,
squirm, and lally gag; make out she’s mortal
offended and play him to a finish. That is,
she would do it if she knew enough—”</p>

<p>Of course, I could not see Mrs. Mount as
she spoke; but her voice—her words and
expression were totally different from what
she used in society. But her words gave a
stimulus to my thoughts. I was very angry.
To be called a “hussy.” And the slurs the
women made against me! I hated her for it,
even more than I hated Jack. And so I
thought again. And then I reached a decision.
I would fulfil Mrs. Mount’s prophecy.
I would repulse Charlie Lien and flirt with
Jack Bang. But I would revenge myself on
both the woman and the man, I mean Charlie
Lien. If Charlie proposes to me I shall say
“NO.” So bids the spirit of my ancestors.</p>

<p>I appeared at dinner and was the sensation
of the moment. I smiled, oh so sweetly, on Mr.
Bang, and after dinner settled down to a book
at the side of Mumsie in the fireside circle.
Mrs. Lien and Mumsie fell to talking. Out of
the vast amount of small talk that I heard,
the following remains in my memory:</p>

<p>“Do you know, Mrs. Somers, my cook absolutely
refused to cook a dinner if Lady
Billings was to be a guest. I reasoned with
her—it was no use. ‘Mrs. Lien,’ said she, ‘I
refuse to cook a dinner for Molly Fenton.’
‘But, Kate,’ I pleaded, ‘I don’t ask you to
serve it. All I ask you to do is to cook it.’
‘I don’t care,’ she answered. ‘I’ll walk out
of your house before I’ll cook a dinner for
Molly Fenton, even if she now is Lady Billings.
When we were children together,
Mother would not allow me to play with her,
and I won’t cook a dinner for her now.’ ”</p>

An Italian navvy once shot and ate an owl, and when
he was asked what he had eaten, he replied: “De chicken wid
de big eye.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 18th.</span></span></p>

<p>I arranged it all most successfully. I really
believe I am diplomatic. Mr. Bang asked me
to go snow-shoeing with him this morning. We
went. The sky was bright, the wind was up
and it was very cold, almost numbing. We
crossed Norway Lake, and down into the
forest, and then we felt no wind, and as we
walked and walked, I felt a gentle glow come
over me.</p>

<p>I soon found I lost myself in the interest
I gained in Mr. Bang’s conversation, just as
I did one day long ago. He told me of the
forest wilds of British Columbia, and trappers’
tales of the deer, and the martin, and
the fisher, and the beaver, and that strange
creature, the Canada-Jay, or Whiskey Jack.</p>

<p>“You talk like an animal story book,” I
remarked.</p>

<p>“Do I?” he asked. “I’m sorry. The animal
story men are fakers, and I would not like
you to think me a faker. There is not a trapper
in the West who is not more or less
conversant with the writings of this class of
authors. All I have heard speak of them,
damn them up and down. Even I dislike
them, and wonder at the public taste. But
then the public is an ass.”</p>

<p>Wapoose is the rabbit of the North. His
tracks were everywhere about. In the North
everybody, everything lives on the rabbit. The
Indians, trappers, the owls, the fox, the wolf,
all feast upon poor wapoose. And like many
another faithful friend he is despised.</p>

<p>But the silence of the forest is oppressive.
Stepping into it one feels as if one entered the
realm of nature. One feels the temporary
guest of the world where a ceaseless war is
being waged, in which the fittest only survive,
where animal life is maintained by the death
of animal life. Nature is as cruel as a steel-trap
that the fur-hunter sets for the fox.</p>

<p>And the trees stand about spectral in the
silence; the firs and spruces with their
branches laden with snow-droop as if in
shame. They picture modesty. The clatter of
a squirrel, or the squeak of a tom-tit, or the
hammer, hammer of the woodpecker come at
long intervals. They merely announce the
great oppressive silence, each striking his own
note.</p>

<p>All the region round about Norway Lake is
a Government game and timber reserve. The
streams are filled with beaver and the woods
with other fur-bearing animals.</p>

<p>We came to a beaver-dam, Mr. Bang recognizing
the rounded ridge in the snow marking
the dam and domes of snow marking the
houses. He told me of the strange family
huddled in these humble homes and the superstitions
they have engendered.</p>

<p>And after two hours tramp we came to
Napoleon’s cabin. Napoleon is one of the
game wardens, and by a strange chance was
known to Mr. Bang. Mr. Bang had planned
our tramp that we might call on his friend.
Napoleon was at home. I really believe Mr.
Bang had sent him word we were coming, as
everything about the cabin was so neat, and
the warm air that greeted us at the open door
was in itself hospitable. It told me I might
take off my wraps and rest and be comfortable.</p>

<p>Napoleon was a grim customer whose broken
English was that of the Canadian French.
His grin was expansive. He asked question
after question of mutual friends in the
Kootenays, but his eye was continually on me;
that is, in a sly way, he was continually glancing
at me.</p>

<p>As I sat perfectly happy and lazy it struck
me I was in an odd position, deep in the
forest, in the cabin of a good-natured savage.
But somehow I felt safe, and I felt I was
absorbing local colour by the bucket-full, and
could now feel superior to the mere reader of
books. I fancied my two companions fighting
wolves, and bears, and wild Indians, all most
exciting. This shows only that in some ways
I have not yet ceased being a child.</p>

<p>Just as Napoleon was putting the finishing
touches on the laying of the lunch table, his
accumulating admiration burst its bounds.</p>

<p>“By gosh! shees look for nice leetle girl,
some day maybe shees Messus Bang, uh?”</p>

<p>Of course, I blushed crimson. Fortunately
Mr. Bang’s face was turned away from me,
and, of course, he could not turn to look at me,
and so could not measure, my confusion. But
I saw his—his confusion. He flushed a moment
and admonished Napoleon not to take
things too seriously. But I had heard it, the
spoken words, “Mrs. Bang.” Really, they
did not sound so very awful. I think the
pleasurable anticipation I felt for the savory
lunch must have made them less objectionable.</p>

<p>I did enjoy that lunch!</p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:larger'><span class='sc'>January 20th.</span></span></p>

<p>I am to be Mrs. Bang and am reconciled.
Fate has spoken and all sensibilities have
been matched by Fate. And oh! what an
adventure was ours. Has all history such
another tale to tell? I know now what my
hate for Jack meant; it was the fight my spirit
put up against his spirit. But his has now
the mastery and I love him. After all, I
believe a woman’s greatest privilege is to
love. It is so much more blessed to give than
to receive. How infinite is the philosophy of
the Bible!</p>

<p>As I held his poor, lacerated head in my lap
in the depths of the forest last night, I gave
up my soul. He murmured, “You have saved
my life,” and I felt it was true. It was all so
tragic, so terrible, so glorious.</p>

<p>As I lie in bed propped up in pillows, my
own head bandaged, I can see them now,
savage, furious, bristling beasts—the World,
the Flesh and the Devil. What power they
held, what fury, hate, and passion! How vast
is the scope of nature.</p>

<p>Jack and I went to Napoleon’s cabin and
had lunch and then it began to snow and we
tarried. And then the snow stopped and we
set out, and the wolves came. How my blood
ran chill as I heard their howling coming
near and nearer. We were too far from
Napoleon’s cabin to retreat, besides their
howlings came from our rear.</p>

<p>I suppose I have no right to call old Devil
by that name, as he was leader of the pack,
but it fitted him so well.</p>

<p>There was no hesitation in his movements.
As an arrow from a twanging bow-string he
sprang at Jack’s throat. Of course, I only
call them the World, the Flesh, and the Devil
for the purposes of this narrative. I am not
trying to turn my diary into an allegory. They
were all devils, but I must individualize them.
Devil was the biggest, strongest, fiercest.</p>

<p>When Jack learned by the howling of the
wolves they were on our trail, he armed himself
with a great club, and after arming me
with a smaller club, he lifted me into the
branches of a birch tree. Then he took up his
stand, my defender, my savior, my hero. He
stood with his back against the tree trunk.</p>

<p>His views of life are so noble, so broad, so
profound. I have told him everything, that
is, almost all about everything. This, of
course, is since the fight. His comment was
so far-reaching, so generous.</p>

<p>Folly visits most homes and most individuals
sometimes in our lives. The thing is to
come through it, and having come through it
not to be worse than when going in, for we
must be wiser. Our grip on life is stronger.
To have made an error in younger life and to
recognize that error makes us surer-footed on
the trail of life, and it gives us a measure of
our powers of resistance.</p>

<p>And then I told him the real climax of my
life, which is the climax of this story, came to
me last Thursday as I sat in the Senate
Chamber. Then the spirit of my ancestor
spoke as it never spoke before. Then I made
my choice; then I realized Society was indeed
the folly of the age. To this he replied with
the question:</p>

<p>“Can you wonder the Chinese worship their
ancestors? Perhaps we—”</p>

<p>“Perhaps we may drop Christianity for
ancestor—”</p>

<p>“It is not necessary to drop Christianity.
Christianity is not incompatible with ancestor-worship.”</p>

<p>Dear Jack!</p>

<p>Darkness was settling down over the scene
and Devil’s eyes gleamed fire as he came. And
so did the eyes of World and Flesh, for the
three were in the air at the same time. Three
pairs of jaws snapped together like steel
traps, pitilessly. Oh! the cruelty of those
jaws.</p>

<p>As the three snapped their jaws, Jack’s club
swung round and they were hurled away. In
the attack Devil sprang at Jack with Flesh
at his left and World at his right. Jack’s
club caught Flesh behind the ear and made
him feel very sorry. And World and Devil
sat on their haunches and snapped.</p>

<p>Jack glared at the wolves and the wolves
glared at Jack. I called to him: “Jack, why
do you not come up into the tree with me?”
It was the first time I had ever called him
Jack.</p>

<p>“That would not do, for if we stayed in the
tree very long we should freeze to death. I
must stay below and fight for us both, dear.”</p>

<p>My hero!</p>

<p>World and Devil sat at a distance and
licked their chops, while Flesh wandered
about with his head bent low.</p>

<p>What woman knowing she was loved by
such a man could help returning his love. We
were primitive, and I’ve heard love is primitive,
back through the ages to when man had
little but his superior intelligence to guard his
love.</p>

<p>As Flesh regained his senses, the three
threshed about up and down and then they
sprang, this time Devil coming at my foot.
Of course, it was all fancy, but I fancied I
felt his hot breath. I foiled his attempt while
Jack managed to hit him over the back. It
was not a very hard blow as its force was
spent ere it reached him, it having actually
been aimed at the other two.</p>

<p>Darkness was settling fast, and this fact
increased my horror. Jack enquired if I were
cold. I answered, no. This was between the
howling of the wolves. Jack asked me if I
could climb higher into the tree. I replied I
could not. Then he told me to pluck from
the tree all the loose bark I could and roll it
into bundles. This I did as the wolves held
a longer council of war. They circled round
and round the tree, ugly, grey, devilish, watchful
brutes. Jack told me to undo the sash I
wore round my waist and lower it to him. This
I did, and then he told me to shout and wave
my arms to attract the wolves’ attention.
When I did as he requested, he drew his knife
and his match-box from his pocket and, placing
his club between his knees, tied them into
the end of the sash and told me to hoist away.
With the knife I managed to secure a much
greater quantity of birch bark. I asked if I
should light any of the bark, but Jack said no,
as it was no use driving the wolves away
unless we beat them. By this he meant that
should we merely frighten them into the
forest depths we were still their prisoners.
The bark was to be for an emergency.</p>

<p>The wolves crept closer, ever watchful, the
cruel beasts! Their howlings and the snap,
snap of their teeth seemed to grow louder and
more frequent. Suddenly they sprang, Devil
at Jack’s throat. Jack had swung his club in
order to guard me; this caused his left
shoulder to remain unprotected. Devil seized
it in his fangs. Fortunately Jack had been
able to throw up his left elbow to protect his
neck, but over he went. Quick as lightning
the other two were on him.</p>

<p>I lighted the birch bark, and with it flaming
in my hand, dropped into the midst of the
raging, struggling pack. Oh! the glory of it—to
rescue the man I loved—and, incidentally,
to save my own life, for I did not know
then that Napoleon was on his way to our
rescue.</p>

<p>First in the face of one, then in the face of
another I flung the flaming bark, and
screamed and shouted. The smell of singeing
hair sickened me, but it frightened them away.
Although they had tasted blood, dear Jack’s
blood, they drew off. And then I remembered.
I placed the flaming bark against the birch
tree; it burst into flames; the forest round
about was lighted up, and then I knelt by the
side of my lover.</p>

<p>Napoleon came. His rifle rang out. Devil
at least was dead.</p>

<p>And now I have Jack, my Jack! The
Mounts and the Liens and all that vulgar,
selfish, self-advertising, wasteful crowd; they
are nothing .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
